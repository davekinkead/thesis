# Computer Simulation & Thought Experiments
 
Thought Experiments are one of the oldest methodological tools used by philosophers.

  - Plato's Alegory of the Cave
  - Zeno??
  - Plutarch's Ship of Theseus
  - Hobbes' State of Nature

Computer simulation by contrast, is one of the newest.

  - Skrimm's Evolution of Cooperation
  - more needed

Despite the significant difference in provenance between the two methods, they share many characteristics. (what)

  - both involve the construction of models to ...
  - both instantiate a model via simulation (digital vs imagination)

While thought experiment and computer simulation are analogous in many ways, there are some important differences.

  - Internal vs external obviously.

  - Computability: Thought experiements must be simple to remain computable.  Computer simulations can handle much greater amounts of complexity.

  - Proximity: The power of thought experiments stems from their accessability & phemonenology.  It is the experience of the result within the imagination that gives them their ooomph.

  - Confidence: We can be


# Digital Thought Experiments

Literate Programming is a software development paradigm that inverts the relationship between code and comments about the code.

History

Why, benefits ...

Building computer simulations with Literate Programming allows us to create digital thought experiments.

  - removes several limitations of thought experiments 

  - corrects some concerns about computer simulations


# Simulation as Argument

We also get something more...

  - functions as premises
  - functional composition as inference/logic??
