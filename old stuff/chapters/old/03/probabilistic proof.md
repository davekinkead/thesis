- probabilistic proof is good enough from an epistemic POV
- uses probabilistic DNA proofs as an example
- large analytic proofs (finite simple groups) don't provide certainty because they are so large (spread over 500 articles)
- neither does discrete computer proof due to possible errors


> A deductive argument is considered by mathematicians (and many philosophers) to be the only legitimate way to establish that a mathematical claim is true. I shall argue that mathemati- cians do not have good grounds for their rejection of probabilistic methods as a means of establishing mathematical truths. Specifically, I shall argue that one particular probabilistic method (which utilizes re- cent DNA technology) has no epistemic drawbacks that are not shared by standard methods of establishing mathematical truths.

> According to Ludwig Wittgenstein,9 "proof, one might say, does not merely show that it is like this, but how it is like this" (ibid., p. 159

> For one thing, probabilistic methods are typically much simpler than those de- terministic methods which perform the same task. ...  Thus, despite an extra source of uncertainty, there will often be less uncertainty overall with probabilistic methods. (p176)
