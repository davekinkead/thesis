Simulation of scientific theories involves complex mathematical models whose algorithms and equations are analytically unsolvable. This means that simulation has it's own kind of epistemogolgy. 

> In many instances, these computer simulations are not simple number-crunching techniques. They involve a complex chain of inferences that serve to transform theoretical structures into specific concrete knowledge of physical systems. (p275)

> I argue that this process of transformation is also a process of knowledge creation, and that it has its own unique epistemology. (p275)

> I also argue that the complex and motley nature of this epistemology suggests that the end results of simulations often do not bear a simple, straightforward relation to the theories from which they stem. (p276)

Simulation is about replacing analytic results with calculation but this is not mere transformation -- it also introduces questions about the reliability of the model and process (not just result) (p276)

Quoting Goodman 1968, p171 ...

> Few terms are used in popular and scientific discourse more promiscuously than "model." 

Outlines a taxonomy of models (p276)

  1. mechanical: 
  2. dynamic
  3. ad hoc
  4. computation
  5. phenonena

    Theory + General Physical Modeling Assumptions
                      |
    Mechanical Model + Parameters, Boundary Values, Initial Data
                      |      
    Dynamical Model + Ad hoc Modeling Assumptions, Approximations, Reduction of Degrees of Freedom
                      |
    Computational Model + Imaging Techniques, Data Analysis, Interpretation
                      |
    Model of the Phenomena


Simulation is non-deductive when is moves from theory to new knowledge about the system (p277).  So what makes these steps acceptable?

Simulation used "in generating closed form functions that are approximately valid." (p278)

Uses finite differencing to "continuous rates of change over infinitesimal intervals, into difference equations, which relate rates of change over finite, or discrete, intervals." (p278)

> The idea here is to develop computer algorithms that embody some simplified version of the original set of equations. (p279)

> The dynamical model needs to be transformed into a computational model so that computational techniques can be used to overcome the problem of analytical intractability. (p281)

> Ad hoc modeling includes such techniques as simplifying assumptions, removing degrees of freedom, and even substituting simpler empirical relationships for more complex, but also more theoretically founded laws (p282)

> There are times when the simulationist is acutely aware of the important influence of one component of the dynamics and yet it is simply impractical to include it in a full-blown simulation. ... Creative ad hoc models typically involve relatively simple mathematical rela- tionships designed to approximately capture some physical effect in nature. (p282)

Traditional philosophy of sciences views epistemology as foundational - the layer cake mode of observation -> theory -> experitmation. Epistemology of simulation works in the other direction. (p285)

> We are concerned with the autonomous sanctioning of conclusions that we drawfrom our scientific theories (p285)

> "Complex mathematical manipulation" together with "essential approxima- tions" are often necessary in order to get theories to yield experimental predictions (Kuhn 1977, 190)

> Simulation modeling is clearly a case of theory articulation in the spirit of Kuhn. It is a nontrivial process of bringing a theoretical structure into resonance with some phenomena that is "implicitly" in its domain. (p286)

> Often simulation will enable us to produce a representation of a certain aspect of nature that is extremely difficult to observe. (p286)

!!!!!!!!

> The realization that techniques of approximation are in fact inferences that require an epistemology that looks at the means of the methods, and not just their ends, is exactly the jumping off point that we need. (p287)

On Visualisation of results ...

> Most of all, the observer is crucial because, absent an observer who can compare images against images, there is no metric of similarity between the different data sets that need to be compared. Visualization is by far the most effective means of identifying characteristic features out of complex dynamical data sets, and so it is the most, if not the only, effective means of judging the degree of calibration a simulation enjoys with other data sets and with analytic results. Thus, visualization plays a crucial role in sanctioning as well as in analyzing simulation results. Not only does the epistemology of simulation call upon resources that are empirical, and that come from outside of the theory, it also calls upon the faculties of the observer. (p290)

> The epistemology of simulation, as we have seen at length, is very much an empirical epistemology, and not merely a mathematico-logical one. (p290)

> our confidence in our physical theories is one of the things that, in combination with other elements, warrants our rational belief that the models we construct are reliable and cognitively useful.(p291)

Datasets can become so large that approximation of their structure is neccessary in order to create "compact representations that facilitate their down-stream management and analysis, and ideally model the underlying sci-entific phenomena with defined numerical fidelity"
