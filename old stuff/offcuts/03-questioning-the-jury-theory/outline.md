## My Argument


### CJT requires certain conditions

  1. introduce CJT
    - wow so good
    - only if certain conditions are satisfied

  2. look at all the conditions

  3. model CJT

### Voter Competence

  1. Voter competence is only justified by the POC

  2. If we are justified in applying the POC then it must be anonymous to indistinguishable polities

  3. model partitioning

  4. principle of anonymity
    - if we are justified in applying to one polity, then we are justified in applying to other similar polities

### Distribution of Competence

  1. introduce distribtion of competence

  2. why is this justified?

  3. model distribution

  4. The POC is not anonymous to indistinguishable polities
    - introduce competence distribution
    - we are not justified in applying the POC to indistinguishable polities!!! 
    - goodin & real life results

### Conclusion

  5. Therefore we are not justified in applying the POC


### Appendix

Appendix - demonstrate that analytic and ABM models are identical



  3. My simulation shows that (whenever CJT is applied to multiple polities), voter competence > 0.5 is not enough - we also need even distribution of competence.  

  4. Acutal results show that these assumptions do not hold - competence isn't evenly spread.

  - the maths of CJT are symmetrical.  we can infer results -> competence (G&E)
  - there is considerable variation of results in real life showing that competence is inconsistent accross issue and geography. Much more than CJT would imply.
  - the anonymity condition makes the application of assumption of competence impossible (~B -> ~A) 
  

  - imagine Trump wins nationally but not in every state. TX votes red while CA votes blue. in order to use CJT, we need to grant the assumptions of competence and these assumptions must be anonymous - if its granted to TX, then it is granted to CA. But results show that the assumptions weren't satisfied in some states (and possibly nation as a whole).  
  - Different results between similar electorates show that we cant the assumption to some.  And if we can't grant it to some, then we can't grant it to similar others.  Because we don't know which electorates can be granted the assumption a priori, we can't grant it to any!
