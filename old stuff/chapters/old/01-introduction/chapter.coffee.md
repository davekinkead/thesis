What is philosophy?  This might strike you as an overly ambitious question to begin a PhD dissertation with.  Metaphilosophy like this is typically only seriously engaged with after many years or decades of focused scholarship.

And I agree. _What is philosophy?_ is far to broad a question to address within the constraints here.  But it does serve as a useful departure point for this endeavour.  This is after all, a thesis about metaphilosophy.  So grant me some leeway for the moment....

One way we might define philosophy is by the subject matter it addresses.  Examples...Ethics, Political Philosophy, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Phenomenology...

But this wont do because philosophy covers every domain.  Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Law, Philosophy of Economics.  Any subject can be approached _philosophically_ -- why not a Philosophy of Hairdressing? [^hair] 

>  What distinguishes a haircut from other events in which one's hair ends up shorter (e.g., fire, lawnmower accident)?
>  Is a good haircut timelessly good, or does the quality of a haircut depend in part on the tides of fashion?
>  Is a good haircut timelessly good, or does the quality of a haircut depend in part on the tides of fashion?
>  Must a haircut please its bearer to be good? Are there, perhaps, several different dimensions of "goodness" to be pulled apart here?
>  To what extent should a haircut be judged by the intent of the hairdresser?

So perhaps philosophy is defined by it's level of application.  While any domain can be the subject of philosophy's investigations, it is the fundamental or abstract nature of the questions it asks that demarcates say, the Philosophy of Biology from Biology simpliciter.  Questions concerning the nature of things, questioning widely held assumptions, why some elements belong to one category and not the other, or more simply asking _why_.

First order and second order investigations....

Given that any subject can be _approached_ philosophically, another way to define philosophy is by reference to its method....

Ryle's claim that metaphilosophy is a waste of time....

Role of empiricism (or absence of it)


So now we are here at the subject of my thesis -- philosophical method.

Computers are ubiquitous in our lives today.  Computer networks allow us to connect and communicate with billions of people around the planet in milliseconds.  This connectedness is transforming they way people work.  For some, that means working remotely from a beach in Thailand or a ski slope in Austria.  For others, this connectedness is eroding job security as many functions from accounting to radiology are being outsourced to regions with lower wage costs.  Whether positive or negative computers are transforming the way we work today.

Unsurprisingly, computational approaches to investigation are also becoming more common place in academia.  Computational biologists use computers to simulate biological and social systems. Computational linguists use computers to develop statistical models of language structures.  Computational physicists use computers to derive numerical approximations of complex physical phenomena.  And computational philosophers use computers to ... well, there really aren't any computational philosophers.

The way these disciplines use computers is what makes them _computational_.  The use of digital devices is far more than the streamlining and augmenting of existing analogy processes -- replacing typing with word processing, or print with digital distribution of journals.  Instead, computational disciplines use digital _methodologies_.  They perform scholarship in ways that wouldn't be possible without computers.

Yet within the academy, philosophy remains a digital laggard.  The use of mathematics and proof has long been part of analytic philosophy at least but the use of computer modelling and simulation is only nascent.  Computational philosophy as a disciple does not yet exist.

This is unfortunate for philosophy because there are many areas of the disciple, especially political, moral, and social philosophy, that could benefit from embracing computational approaches.  Political philosophy for example, involves the study of complex systems with emergent properties like human societies and economies.  As such, experimental data is difficult to observe and causal inferences are difficult to make.  Unlike the physical sciences, the social scientist and philosopher cannot hold variables fixed, make precise interventions, or re-run experiments with ease.

It is here that computational approaches to philosophy can help.  It can overcome the existing epistemic limitations found in traditional philosophy methods - analytic intractability, the inability to experiment, and the challenge of complexity and emergent behaviour.



## Philsophy & Method






## Democracy and Borders 


Many accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.  Democracy brings about good things.  These outcomes might be judged according to some content independent criteria - that say, democracy tracks the truth.  They might be judged according to some content relative criteria - that democracy maximises individual preferences. Or they might be judged according to some content-indifferent criteria - that democracy improves the moral character of its citizens.

The outcomes of these processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.  Including different people amongst _the people_ can change the outcome of the democratic process.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.

Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, and different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy like Condorcet's or Estlund's for example, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Without this diversity within polities, democracy has no epistemic value.

Content-relative justifications of democracy like preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion).  These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.

The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion.  That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress.  Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.

Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help.  Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another.  Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this.  But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes.  This however only says what is necessary for _any_ political association.  

The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter.  This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi.  A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones.  Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones.  And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.  

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.


## School Performance



> Most people would accept the claim that schooling somehow affects student achievement.  After all, as a society we invest significant amounts of time and money in various endeavours trying to measure exactly this.  Measuring the impact of schooling on student achievement however, faces a significant epistemic challenge.  Because we can't measure the causal impact of schooling on student achievement directly, we can't know this causal impact with certainty.  Instead, we _infer_ the causal impact of schooling on student achievement by way of proxy measures such as student results.  If student results improve, then we can _infer_ that some aspect of schooling _caused_ this...perhaps.

> How warranted is this inference from student results to school performance?  With the aid of computer simulation, I investigate the robustness of this inference mechanism in a variety of common scenarios.  By eliminating errors and abstracting away confounders, computer simulation allows us to create the ideal conditions from which to assess the quality of this inference.

> I show that under a variety of common scenarios, the inference from student results to school performance is not warranted - even under ideal conditions.  Because if we can't infer school performance reliably in ideal conditions, then we certainly can't do so in the non-ideal conditions of the real world.  This article advances the literature by demonstrating in inherent difficulty, and perhaps even pointlessness, of trying to infer _school performance from student results_.
