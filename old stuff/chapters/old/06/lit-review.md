> Iterated PD.

> The familiar problem of whether Hobbesian men in the state of nature would ever abide by an agreement to obey a Sovereign is a version of the puzzle now known as‘Prisoner's Dilemma'. The present paper has the following aims: (1) To establish that the game-theory approach is a legitimate way to study Hobbes. (2) To see whether a proposed 'solution’to the paradox of Prisoner's Dilemma applies to this example. The paradox is that individually rational self-interested calculations sum to an outcome that is suboptimal not only for society but also for every single member of it. The solution is the Supergame which consists of indefinitely repeated plays of the simple Prisoner's Dilemma game. (3) To compare the results of the above with the similar conclusions reached by a different route by recent arguments in sociobiology.

> Arguably, then, Leviathan is not so much an account of the origins of obligation as a warning against overthrowing extant sovereignty. p341

> The alternative approach starts from the observation that Hobbes’s solution to the Social Contract game is clearly dynamic, not static: p342

> I propose to call it ‘Hobbesian anarchism’. p342

Some objections to the iterated game.

  - last game paradox p343
  - very high discount rate p344
  - n > 2 person games p344
  - beggar-thy-neighbour (zero sum games) p345

> If the game is pure beggar-my-neighbour, then it is zero-sum and no Co-operative outcomes are possible p345 ie for positional goods like relative status.

> Hobbes names Competition, Diffidence and Glory as the ‘three principal causes of quarrell’ that make the state of nature a state of war p345

> Rational self-interested Co-operators would not need Leviathan or any other enforcing agency: they would all obey the Laws of Nature out of enlightened self-interest. However, the anarchist solution is precarious. It depends on the players’ all having sufficiently low discount rates and on there being enough-just enough-Co-operators in the society to sustain co- operation. p346

> Retaliators do not do better than Hawks if some animals are bigger and stronger than others, and know that they are. In that event, the co-operative equilibrium could not arise anarchistially. p350



## Kavka, Gregory S. 1983. Hobbes’s war of all against all. Ethics 93: 291–310.

> In Leviathan, Hobbes offers a hypothetical contract argument in support of the conclusion that political sovereigns have absolute and unlimited authority over their subjects, and that-save when their survival is immediately at stake-these subjects are morally obligated to obey all of their sovereign's commands.  p296

> I have suggested that Hobbes's discussion of the problem of individual security contains two basic flaws: (a) it overlooks the possibility of rational present cooperation based on the expectation of future cooperation, and (b) it oversimplifies and inaccurately portrays the relationship between security and the concentration of power within a group p309

- Gauthier thinks CH13 is obviously correct. p291

> I shall argue that these attitudes are not warranted. Hobbes's argument relies only on assumptions about human beings that are much more plausible than psychological egoism, but it is invalid. p291

> Hobbes argues that people living in a state of nature, without a common power over them to keep them in awe, are in a state of war of every person against every other. p292

>  So a war of all against all is a state in which each knows that every other is willing to fight him, not one in which each is constantly fighting

> To prove the state of nature is a state of war, Hobbes begins with
five assumptions. p292

> 1. Natural equality
> 2. Conflicting desires
> 3. Forward Lookers
> 4. Advantage of anticipation
> 5. Limited altruism

> From these five quite reasonable and realistic assumptions about human beings, Hobbes constructs an elegant and insightful argument for the state of nature being a state of war p293

There are no moral restraints from violence in the state of nature because everyone has the natural right to defend themselves however necessary.

> Third, and most important, even "moderate" people, who have no desire for power or glory for its own sake and who may have no specific quarrels with one, may, for defensive purposes, engage in anticipatory violence against one.' p294

> In Hobbes's words, ". . . there is no way for any man to secure himself, so reasonable, as anticipation.' p294

Cognition is important...

> For a universal state of war to exist, it is not enough that anticipation be the most reasonable strategy, it must also be believed so by all who do not wish to fight for other reasons, and most must be aware that others so believe it p294

> McNeilly believes that Hobbes employs the method of mathematics in his political philosophy. He thus constructs an interpretation of the state of war argument as a logical deduction from formal definitions. On his view, what the argument shows is that it is a necessary truth that human beings not living under a common power (i.e., living in a state of nature) will be in a state of war that constitutes a state of despair in Hobbes's sense: a state in which they have no hope of attaining their objectives. p295

>  He contends, however, that the second alternative is basically illusory. Because of the constant danger of factionalism, civil war, and social disintegration in a group governed by a limited or divided power, such a form of social organization does not provide its members with sufficient security to really remove them from the state of nature p296 (see Ch17)

>  The argument that the state of nature is a state of war of all against all supplies the crucial remaining premise that allows Hobbes to conclude that the parties would choose the absolute sovereign as the lesser evil. p297

Argues against the Hobbes' premises

The reasonableness of anticipatory violence

>  Despite the fact that this crucial inference has escaped criticism in the literature, it is clear that it is fallacious. p298

The inability of emergent coalitions to form

> Lying low is not, however, the most attractive alternative to anticipation. Joining with others in a defensive coalition promises to yield much greater benefit p298

> But less extensive coalition arrangements still within the state of nature are imaginable, the simplest being an exchange, among a number of persons, of promises of mutual aid in case of attack. p298

> Thus, Hobbes would argue that it is unreasonable for you to risk your life to save your partner (or his land), since he may well flee when you or your property is attacked. Further, your coalition partner's awareness that you may reason in this way and not keep the pact in the future, makes it even more likely that he will not come to your aid p299

Kavka now uses an iterated PD to argue the plausibility of emergent coalitions. p300

> We repeat most emphatically that our theory is thoroughly static. A dynamic theory would unquestionably be more complete and therefore preferable. But there is ample evidence from other branches of science that it is futile to try to build one as long as the static side is not thoroughly understood. (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1953, p. 44)

> The inability to model the dynamical element of game play in traditional game theory, and the extent to which evolutionary game theory naturally incorporates dynamical considerations, reveals an important virtue of evolutionary game theory. (SEP)

> These models may also be viewed as modules that, once evolved, may be put together to form more complex interactions. Evolutionary games may be studied from a both a static and dynamic point of view. Static analysis of equilibria reveals a lot about the structure of the interaction, and it can be carried out at a level of generality that does not commit one to a particular dynamics. But dynamic analysis sometimes reveals complexities that are not immediately apparent from the study of equilibria. Dynamic analyses may be mathematically challenging. Computer simulations are always available as a tool, but in these simple game-theoretic models, analytic methods are also applicable.  http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/364/1518/771.short

- evolutonary models can deal with limited or bounded rationality of agent where as traditional static utility base game theory cannot.


# Why Hobbes’ State of Nature is Best Modeled by an Assurance Game
M Moehler - Utilitas, 2009 - Cambridge Univ Press

A paper to reconstruct Hobbes using game theory, not to critique him.

> Modern social philosophy has been strongly influenced by the prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game. p297

> The dilemma from the perspective of social philosophy is that it is never rational to cooperate in a (one-shot) PD game. Instead, defection is the strictly dominant strategy. p297

> I argue that if one closely follows Hobbes’ line of reasoning in Leviathan, in particular his distinction between the second and the third law of nature, and the logic of his contractarian theory, then Hobbes’ state of nature is best translated into the language of game theory by an assurance game. p298

> The one- shot PD game can model the interaction of Fooles, who misconstrue the game in the state of nature due to their short-sightedness. The assurance dilemma game can model the interaction of Fooles with prudent individuals. p298

> According to Hobbes, the sovereign must exclude free riders from the cooperative framework, or even take their lives, if they are detected. p299

> My aim is only to translate Hobbes’ state of nature argument, as closely as possible, into the language of standard game theory. p303

Moehler is modelling how men behave in the state of nature and infering what actions the Leviathan must take.

> In game-theoretic terms, the sovereign is assumed to play a grim strategy with the citizens once society is established. p299
