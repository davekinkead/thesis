# Two Types of Science

There are two archetypes of scholarship in science.  In one, scientists observe the world, formulate hypotheses, conduct experiments, and measure results.  When they are done they share their findings in a paper by describing their methodology, reporting their results, before arguing why this evidence better supports one theory over another.  Call this the scholarship of experimental science. 

In another, scientists build theories, construct models, and argue in a paper why one theory is more coherent than another.  Call this the scholarship of theoretical science.

These archetypes are extremes on a scale rather than dichotomies.  Actual scientific scholarship tends to be more one type than the other, yet these archetypes have been widely described for centuries.  And while both forms of scholarship are use argument to establish the warrant of their thesis, the epistemological foundations of their arguments are distinct.

Experimental scholarship reports results and uses argument to show what does or does not follow from them. The epistemological source of the premises is testimonial.  Short of reproducing the experiment themselves, there is no way to independently verify those claims.  The audience of experimental scholarship must _trust_ that the scientist is both honest and accurate.

Theoretical scholarship does not face this challenge.  The theoretical scientist is free to simply begin with widely accepted beliefs and argue from there.   We don't need to place our trust in the theoretical scientist's honesty because we already accept (or can easily verify) the premises.  We don't need to place our trust in the theoretical scientist's accuracy because we can read the argument for ourselves.  All we as the audience need do is evaluate the quality of the warrant. 

The use of computer simulation in science over the last 50 years appears to blend the epistemological characterises of these two archetypes.  On one hand, simulations are purely deductive or probabilistic affairs -- conditions and behaviour of the desiderata are defined gesticulatively, the results of what follows from these stipulations are examined.

On the other hand, the results of computer simulation often have the appearance of experiment -- empiric-like data is generated from the simulated 'experiments' and analysed like any other experiment.

The scholarship of computational science, however, clearly fits the archetype of experimental scholarship.  Simulations generate results, these results are reported, and then form the premises of arguments to show why one theory is more plausible than another.  The epistemological foundations of computational scholarship in science remains testimonial.  We must still trust that the computational scientist is both honest and accurate.

While modern science and philosophy share many epistemological features and a common lineage, a clear methodological difference is that philosophy stands firmly in the theoretical camp (experimental philosophy not withstanding).  Philosophy may (and should) be informed by empirical science but it is first and foremost, a way of generating knowledge via argument.  Most importantly, argument in philosophy begins from premises whose truth is established independently from the argument being offered.  It is the epistemological independence of the premises that clearly distinguishes philosophy from experimental science.

Yet since computation and computer simulation have begun to be used in philosophy, the scholarship of computational philosophy mirrors that of experimental science. Philosophers observe the world, formulate hypotheses, run a computer simulation, and measure results.  When they are done they share their findings in a paper by describing their model (but rarely their code), and reporting their results before arguing why this evidence better supports one theory over another. 

The epistemological source of the premises in the arguments in computational philosophy remains testimonial.

Simulation-as-testimony presents many of the same challenges that experiment-as-testimony does.  The first is the problem of trust that applies to all forms of testimony -- that the audience must trust both that those offering testimony are both honest and accurate.

The problem of honesty in scholarship is a real but minor one. Scholars are overwhelming honest and professional, and instances of academic misconduct are the exception rather than the rule.  

Of much greater concern however, is the accuracy of scientific results. Even ignoring the crisis of replication in psychology and medicine, scientific progress is measured by the _revision_ of what we think is true as our knowledge is revised and sometimes rejected.  As such, the testimonial claims of scientific results _must_ be subjected to scrutiny before we can use them to warrant subsequent conclusions.
   
The epistemological challenges of experiment-as-testimony are much worse for simulation-as-testimony because simulations have no real constraints and are highly sensitive to parameter choices.  The results in natural science experiments are constrained by reality.  Gravity is gravity for example -- it works the same anywhere in the universe (although perhaps not in black holes).  But simulations have no real constraints -- how we code gravity in one simulation might be different to how we code it in another, depending on the code's author, language, and run time. 

Similarly, the results of a simulation can be highly sensitive to changes in parameterisation.  Small changes in parameters and initial conditions can lead to large changes in results.  The field of chaos theory for example, was born when tiny rounding errors in weather simulations resulting in radically different outcomes in identical models.  Even if we code gravity the same in all of our simulations, minor changes in initial conditions can undermine the confidence in our results.

Which brings us to simulations in philosophy.  Argument is central to philosophy and these arguments usually begin on firm footing with premises that the audience already accepts as reasonable and which are knowable independently of the argument being offered.

When philosophy uses computer simulation however, the role of simulation is testimonial and the truth or reasonableness of its premises are not knowable independently of the argument.  We must trust the philosopher-coder that their simulation does what they say it does.

Yet the crux of the argument in which simulation is used often rests in the assumptions and claims parameterised within the code.  The key inferences of the simulation are hidden away from the audience (although sometimes made available on request).

It needn't be this way however. There are other ways to use simulation -- simulation-as-argument -- which allow simulation to be a fundamental part of philosophical argument, not merely a footnote to it.  But for as long as we use simulation as testimony, the ability of it to increase the warrant of our claims, to increase the rational persuasion of argument will be limited.
