why use simulation

- good theoretical understanding but the domain is highly complex or adaptive (fluids, non-linear partial differential equations)
- limited theoretical understanding but component behavior understood (traffic, birds flocking)

- monte carlo???

 Ronald Laymon. Laymon has written extensively on the use of approximations and idealizations in deriving conclusions from theories, including one paper that specifically addresses their role in computer simulation. 

 epistemology of approximation

 Allen Franklin offered in "The Epistemology of Experi- ment," a chapter of his book, The Neglect of Experiment (1986).
