## Thirteen theorems in search of the truth

@Grofman, B., Owen, G., & Feld, S. L. (1983). Thirteen theorems in search of the truth. Theory and Decision, 15, 261–278.

> ABSTRACT. We review recent work on the accuracy of group judgmental processes as a function of (a) the competences (judgmental accuracies) of individual group members, (b) the group decision procedure, and (c) group size.This work on individual competence and group accuracy represents an important contribution to democratic theory and a useful Complement to the usual emphasis in the social choice literature on individual preference and preference aggregation mechanisms. The work reported on is rooted in a tradition which goes back to scholars such as Condorcet, Poisson, and Bayes.

All of the theorems in this paper deal with dichotomous choice, p262

Outlines standard notation on the subject. p263

Assumptions for CJT p264

> Voters' choices are independent of one another.
> (2) Voters are homogeneous, i.e., Pi = P = P for all i.
> (3) The group decision rule is simple majority.
> (4) There are exactly two alternatives, only one of which is correct (or equivalently, > one of which is 'better' than the other).
> (5) The prior odds as to which of the two alternatives is the correct
> (better) one are even.

## Majority Systems and the Condorcet Jury Theorem

@Boland, P. J., 1989, “Majority systems and the Condorcet jury theorem.” Statistician, 38: 181–189.

> Condorcet argued that there are situations [the CJT assumptions] where it is advisable to entrust a decision to a group of individuals of lesser competence than to a single individual of greater competence. p181

Boland generalizes CJT for when voter competence varies and there is some dependence between voters.

Graph on p186 - the greater the dependence, the less the CJT effect.  Increasing R (the dependence between voters) is the same as decreasing N.


## Proving A Distribution-free Generalization Of The Condorcet Jury Theorem
@owen1989

> In particular, Grofman (1978) generalized the Condorcet Jury Theorem by replacing Assumption 2 (voter homo- geneity) with the assumption that voter competence is normally distributed with a variance equal to the binomial variance. p3

> Theorem II also shows us that, for large n, except for the ‘knife-edge’ case p =t, if we know p (indeed if we merely know whether p is less than or greater than +, we would know virtually all we needed to estimate group competence.  p4

> Part (3) of Theorem II, which gives the quite paradoxical result that groups which are on average ‘half-wits’ (a=+) can gener- ate a group judgmental competence anywhere from 0.39 to 0.61 - a result which does not ‘go away’ with increasing n.


## The Condorcet Jury Theorem, Free Speech, and Correlated Votes

@Ladha, K. K. (1992). The Condorcet jury theorem, free speech, and correlated votes. American Journal of Political Science, 36(3), 617–634.

Ladha generalises the CJT assumption related to correlated votes.

Key assumptions: they vote individually and share a common goal.  This can be viewed as sincerity.

Findings: CJT can be generalised for large groups but not for small ones.  The likelihood that the majority is correct is inversely related to the averages of the coefficients of correlation.

Because of this, opposing views are critical to democratic function p618

> Abstract: With the aid of a simple discrete probability model, the Condorcet Jury Theorem is extended to situations where there is correlation between judgments. It is shown that negative intra-voter correlation improves on jury competence in the sense that the probability of a correct decision increases. Positive correlation, on the other hand, tends to decrease jury competence. Although dependence among jury members has the effect that jury competence no longer approaches infallibility as the size of the jury increases, jury competence is still better than individual competence.


## Condorcet’s jury theorem in light of de Finetti’s theorem: Majority-rule voting with correlated votes

@Ladha, K. K. (1993). Condorcet’s jury theorem in light of de Finetti’s theorem: Majority-rule voting with correlated votes. Social Choice and Welfare, 10, 69–85.

> This paper generalizes Condorcet's jury theorem to the case of symmetrically dependent votes with the help of de Finetti's theorem. Thus, the paper relaxes Condorcet's assumption of independent voting while preserving his main result: In jury-type situations a majority of voters is more likely than any single voter to choose the better of two alternatives

> This paper seeks to generalize CJT for symmetrically dependent votes p70

> Condorcet's jury theorem is known to hold if (i) the votes are i.i.d., and (ii) each member votes for the true state, say s0, with some constant probability p > 0.5. This paper demonstrates that CJT would hold if (a) the votes are embeddable in an infinite sequence of exchangeable votes, and (b) each member votes for so with a random probability e such that e is either symmetrically or beta distributed with E(e) > 0.5. Thus, CJT is generalized to correlated votes because (i) implies (a) and (ii) implies (b)) p82

@Austen-Smith, D. and J. S. Banks, 1996, “Information Aggregation, Rationality, and the Condorcet Jury Theorem.” American Political Science Review, 90: 34–45.

Condorcet’s Jury Theorem relies on the assumption that voting is sincere.  Austen-Smith and Banks show that sincere behaviour by all individuals is not even rational even when a common preference is held.


## The optimal decision rule for fixed-size committees in dichotomous choice situations

@Ben-Yashar, R. C., & Nitzan, S. (1997). The optimal decision rule for fixed-size committees in dichotomous choice situations: The general result. International Economic Review, 38(1), 175–186.

This paper generalises a result for determining the optimal decision rule for a given committee size.

For equally skilled voters, the optimal pairwise decision procedure is qualified majority rule.  In an uncertain dichotomous choice setting, the optimal procedure is qualified weighted majority rule. p185



## A brief note on a further refinement of the Condorcet Jury Theorem for heterogeneous groups

@Kanazawa, S. (1998). A brief note on a further refinement of the Condorcet Jury Theorem for heterogeneous groups. Mathematical Social Sciences, 35, 69–73.

> Abstract: I extend Boland's (1989) work on the Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT) for heterogeneous groups. I demonstrate that, as long as CJT holds (in that the mean individual competence ≥(1/2)+(1/2n)), heterogeneous groups are better at making the correct decision than homogeneous groups for any given level of mean competence. I also extend CJT to collective decision rules other than simple majority, and show that CJT holds for groups with supermajority decision rules if the mean individual competence is at least (π(n+1)/n) (where π=required majority).

CJT's assumptions: p69

  (1) There are exactly two alternatives.
  (2) All individuals share a common preference such that one of the alternatives is superior to all in light of full information.
  (3) The individual decisions are independent of one another.
  (4) Each individual makes the right decision with the probability p . 0.5; individuals are homogenous in p.
  (5) The collective decision rule is simple majority.

> If all of these conditions hold, then the probability that the majority of a group of size n makes the right decision, PN, is always greater than p, and very quickly approaches 1 as n or p increases p70

> Miller (1986) relaxes Condition (2) and extends CJT to groups that contain two opposing subgroups where there are no ‘‘right’’ or ‘‘wrong’’ decisions. He shows that P 9 , the probability that N the majority opinion will prevail, is always greater than p for large n. Thus Miller extends CJT from ‘‘juries’’ (where the right decision is the same for all jurors) to democratic ‘‘electorates’’ (where there are conflicting opinions about which is the right decision).

> In this brief note, I will build on Boland’s (1989) work and derive another theorem from Hoeffding (1956) to demonstrate that, for any given level of average competence (p ̄), heterogeneous groups are more capable of arriving at the right decision than homogeneous groups (Theorem 1 below). I will also relax Condition (5), which has hitherto been unattempted to my knowledge, and show the implications for CJT of various collective decision rules other than simple majority (Theorem 2 below). p 70

> Theorem 2 demonstrates that CJT holds for heterogeneous groups (in that PN.p ̄)
regardless of the collective decision rule, as long as p ̄ is at least (p(n11)/n). It is obvious that Boland’s (1989) Theorem 3 (CJT for heterogeneous groups) is a special case of my Theorem 2 where p5(1/2). p72

The implication here is that simple majorities require a lower competence than super majorities. 

> This result lends further support for diversity of opinions and dissent as a means of arriving at the correct collective decision under democratic majoritarian rules (Grofman and Feld, 1988; Ladha, 1992; Miller, 1986). 


## Stay away from fair coins: A Condorcet jury theorem

@Paroush, J. (1998). Stay away from fair coins: A Condorcet jury theorem. Social Choice and Welfare, 15, 15–20.

> A Condorcet Jury Theorem is a formulation of sufficient conditions that justify the Condorcet statement and makes it true. p16

Paroush relaxes the competence requirement so that individual competence is bounded away from 0.5.  

> Individuals who are almost close to 0.5 do not (necessarily) contribute to the democratic decision making process. p19

## When is Condorcet's Jury Theorem valid?

@Berend, D. and J. Paroush, 1998, “When is Condorcet's Jury Theorem valid?” Social Choice and Welfare, 15: 481–488.

> Abstract:  Existing proofs of Condorcet's Jury Theorem formulate only sufficient conditions for its validity. This paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions for Condorcet's Jury Theorem. The framework of the analysis is the case of heterogeneous decisional competence, but the independence assumption is maintained.

> Condorcet believed that a group of individuals facing a binary choice and utilizing a simple majority rule would be likely to make the correct choice. p481

> A Condorcet's Jury Theorem (hereafter CJT) is a formulation of a su cient condition (or conditions) that substantiates this belief.

Lit review on relaxing assumptions:

> Recently, there have been several attempts to generalize the popular version of CJT. Berg (1993a,b) and Ladha (1992, 1995) relax the indepen- dence assumption and allow for correlated votes. Grofman et al. (1983), Owen et al. (1989) and Paroush (1998) consider distribution-free team members' competence levels. Austen-Smith et al. (1996) analyze the case of insincere voting, and Louis et al. (1996) extend the dichotomous setup to a polychotomous one. The common denominator of all these studies is that they formulate only su cient conditions for the above Condorcet's belief. 

> We adopt the dichotomous choice model with independent and sincere voting, but without any restrictions on the distribution of the decisional competence of the team members. p482


## Epistemic Democracy: Generalizing the Condorcet Jury Theorem

List & Goodin 2001


## A note on the Condorcet Jury Theorem with supermajority voting rules

@Fey, M. (2003). A note on the Condorcet jury theorem with supermajority voting rules. Social Choice and Welfare, 20, 27–32.

> In this note, we examine the question of jury theorems with super-majority rules. We give two theorems, one dealing with homogeneous groups (in which voters are identically competent) and the other dealing with heterogeneous groups (in which voters differ in their ability to perceive which alternative is better). We show that, in large enough electorates, a jury theorem holds as long as the average competence of the voters is greater than the fraction of votes needed for passage. p28


## On the significance of the absolute margin

@List, C. (2004). On the significance of the absolute margin. British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, 55, 521–544.

List derives a more generalised version of the CJT that reinforces the importance of the absolute margin p(H|E) vs p(~H|E) but that this also depends on the prior p(H).

The significance of the absolute margin can be reduced if the assumption of symmetric jurior competence is relaxed.

## The persuasiveness of democratic majorities

@Goodin, Robert E and Estlund, David

> Under the assumptions of the standard Condorcet Jury Theorem, majority verdicts are virtually certain to be correct if the competence of voters is greater than one-half, and virtually certain to be incorrect if voter competence is less than one-half. But which is the case? Here we turn the Jury Theorem on its head, to provide one way of addressing that question. The same logic implies that, if the outcome saw 60 percent of voters supporting one proposition and 40 percent the other, then average voter competence must either be 0.60 or 0.40. We still have to decide which, but limiting the choice to those two values is a considerable aid in that.

If voter competence is uniform, then:

> In the electoral application, given a large number of independent voters, the proportion of people Vi that votes for a proposition øi will be very near to the probability pi of each person independently voting for øi. Thus, if each person is independently 62 percent likely to vote for øi, then (among a large number of such voters) øi will win something very close to a 62 percent majority of the votes. p132

CJT is a rapidly increasing function (p132)

          N
    PN =  Σ (N!/[N–i]!i!)(pc)i (1–pc)N–i
         i=m

> Thus, among electorates of even just moderate-sized towns, much less large nations, the majority is almost certain to choose the right option, just so long as each voter is independently more than half-likely to be right in a two- option choice (but conversely of course if each voter is less than half-likely to be right). p133

On the symetrical implication of CJT

> The problem is merely in deciding what to make of it — whether to regard it as blessing democratic outcomes or as damning them. In terms of the CJT, that depends purely on whether people on average are better than random, or not, in making political decisions involving matters of fact. p133

>   - Most of the propositions that are put to a vote do not admit of any easy, objective test of truth. The fact that there is a good case to be made on both sides is precisely why we put the issue to a vote in the first place.

>   - Survey research shows that the electorate is woefully ill-informed about most matters of public affairs. 

>   - If, however, voters all cued on the same sources of information, and those sources were misleading, then there might be a ‘common mode failure’ that could well lead voters individually and hence collectively to perform systematically worse than random.

> the question of whether voters are on average better than random is not easily decidable when approached head-on. p133

> The CJT uses the law of large numbers to pass from assumptions about pc (voter competence) to conclusions about Vc (the share of the vote won by the correct outcome). Here we propose to work in the reverse direction, deriving inferences about voter competence (pc) from the actual distributions of votes (Vi).

Assumtions of uniformity

> The CJT typically works with simplifying assumptions of uniform voter competence in two dimensions. First, it is typically assumed that each voter is as competent as each other voter; and second, these discussions typically proceed as if voters were equally competent across all subjects. Neither assumption is strictly necessary. p135

> Voters need not have identical competence; the CJT can be re-proven using the mean competence of voters of varying competence, just so long as the distribution of voter competences is symmetrical around the mean.

> The CJT’s basic conclusion — that democracy is a good truth-tracker — holds just so long as the mean voter is ‘better than random’ on each topic. There is no need for them to be equally competent across all topics.

Voter competence cannot be uniformly distributed.

> From the simple fact that different elections are decided by different margins, it immediately follows that voter competences must differ across different subject matters (insofar as voters vote purely on the basis of perceived truths).

Footnote on the Principle of Charity:

> Some might suppose that, as a sort of extension and generalization of the ‘prin- ciple of charity’, we ought (unless we have some special story to tell about how this case is unusual) ordinarily suppose that our fellow citizens are more likely to be right than wrong, and therefore that the winning outcome is quite probably the correct one. p136

> The ‘principle of charity’ is explicitly appealed to as grounds for trusting the testimony of others, in different fashions, by both C.A.J. Coady, Testimony (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1992), Ch. 9 and Tyler Burge, ‘Content Preservation’, Philosophical Review 102 (1993): 457–488, p. 487. Note that, however similar in spirit, this cannot be literally the same ‘principle of charity’ as Davidson’s, as shown by Gary Ebbs, ‘Learning from Others’, Nous 36 (2002): 525–549.

Large majorities can indicate lack of independence

> But looking at the proportional breakdown of the vote, and asking ourselves whether that is more plausibly a reflection of voter competence or voter interests and biases, is a useful supplement to the ordinary battery of bias-detectors.


Conclusion

> in the standard CJT we only have to decide whether or not voters on average are more likely to be right than random. If they are, and the other assumptions of the CJT are met, then the verdict of a large electorate is epistemically compelling; if they are not, then their verdict is almost certain to be epistemically in error. p140

> It is an unpleasantly counter-intuitive feature of the CJT, as ordinarily construed, that a 51:49 majority is very, very nearly as likely to be correct as is the majority in a 70:30 landslide, just so long as the electorate is large. 


## The Condorcet jury-theorem with two independent error-probabilities

@Kirstein, R. (2006). The Condorcet jury-theorem with two independent error-probabilities. Paper 20, German Working Papers in Law and Economics.

> The Condorcet jury-theorem is derived from the implicit assump- tion that jury members may only commit one type of error. In binary decision situations however, two error types may occur, the probabil- ity of which is independent of each other. Taking this into account leads to a generalization of the theorem.

The argument:

1. The CJT focuses on binary decisions.
2. Such decision situations are governed by two error types, the probabilities of which are independent from each other. 
3. This fact is not taken into account in the original CJT.

Conclusion:

> According to the CHT, a jury of three homogenous members makes better decisions than each single member if they have positive detection skill and are neither too suspect- friendly nor too suspect-hostile.

> Hence, the CHT demonstrates that a probability of a correct decision which is greater than 0.5 is neither sufficient, nor necessary for the jury decision to have higher quality than an individual decision.  p11

> Abstract: This paper proves two theorems for homogeneous juries that arise from different solutions to the problem of aggregation of dichotomous choice. In the first theorem, negative correlation increases the competence of the jury, while positive correlation has the opposite effect. An enlargement of the jury with positive correlation can be detrimental up to a certain size, beyond which it becomes beneficial. The second theorem finds a family of distributions for which correlation has no effect on a jury's competence. The approach allows us to compute the bounds on a jury's competence as the maximum and minimum probability of it being correct for a given individual competence and dependence structure.

Condorcet's Assumptions

> Condorcet’s Jury Theorem (CJT) is a mathematical formalization of his ideas. In its classic version the theorem rests on the following four assumptions: (a) the jury decides between two alternatives by voting under simple majority rule, (b) each juror has a more than an even probability of being correct (competence), (c) these probabilities are equal for all jurors (homogeneity), and (d) each juror votes independently. Then, 
>
> 1. any jury comprising an odd number of jurors is more likely than any single juror to select the correct alternative;
> 2. this likelihood becomes a certainty as the size of the jury tends to infinity.
> 
> It is customary to refer to 1 as the non-asymptotic and 2 as the asymptotic part of the theorem. p454

> The non-asymptotic part of the theorem does not generally hold for heterogeneous juries. p454

> Ben-Yashar and Paroush (2000) propose a refinement of the CJT that remains valid regardless of the specific distribution of competence within a jury. They show the non-asymptotic part of CJT to hold if the average competence of a randomly chosen group of more than three jurors is higher than that of any single juror. Berend and Sapir (2005) extended this result to show that a random augmentation of a randomly chosen group always improves the competence of the group.

> It shows that negative correlation increases the competence of the jury, while posi- tive correlation decreases the competence of the jury. It also shows that for positive correlation, an enlargement of the jury can be detrimental up to a certain size beyond which it becomes beneficial. The second theorem finds a family of distributions for which this probability under simple majority rule is independent of the correlation coefficient. p467

# The Premises Of Condorcet’s Jury Theorem Are Not Simultaneously Justified

@Dietrich2008

> Condorcet’s famous jury theorem reaches an optimistic conclusion on the correctness of majority decisions, based on two controversial premises about voters: they are competent and vote independently, in a technical sense. I carefully analyse these premises and show that: (i) whether a premise is justified depends on the notion of probability considered and (ii) none of the notions renders both premises simultaneously justified. Under the perhaps most interesting notions, the independence assumption should be weakened. p56

DJT needs to satisfy two conditions: independence and competence.

Franz's Definition of CJT:

> Roughly stated, the classic Condorcet Jury Theorem1 (CJT) asserts that if a group (jury, population, etc.) takes a majority vote between two alternatives of which exactly one is objectively “correct”, and if the voters satisfy two technical conditions, competence and independence, then the probability that the majority picks the correct alternative increases to one (certainty) as the group size tends to infinity.

Central Claim: "unfortunately, in each case exactly one of the premises is not justified." p56

> I accordingly label these versions the fixed-problem CJT and the variable-problem CJT ... In the fixed-problem CJT, competence is the problematic assumption, whereas in the variable-problem CJT, independence is problematic. So the two versions of the CJT, which might have appeared to be just notational variants, are in fact fundamentally distinct.

> What has gone wrong in the argument? To justify the competence assumption, I have appealed to a variable decision problem, one that is picked at random from a class of relevant problems. But to justify the independence assumption, I have fixed (i.e. conditionalised on) the decision problem, with its particular body of evidence, process of group deliberation, and so on. One cannot have it both ways. p57

> I believe that most arguments made in the literature for or against some premise are correct under the author’s notion of uncertainty, and incorrect under other notions.

> I define a decision problem as the task of finding a certain correct alternative x (0 or 1) under certain circumstances c.  p58

> Evidential circumstances are generally observable facts that support the correctness of alternative 0 or 1.

> Non-evidential circumstances are events that carry no information on which alternative is correct but may affect different voters in their voting behaviour, such as room temperature while voting, whether birds are singing

!!!

> knowing whether [average competence] holds for this specific problem might be even harder than knowing the true state x in the first place.  To know whether (Com) holds, one would have to know whether the specific problem involves misleading evidence, which one can hardly know without knowing the true state x. p60

> Importantly, though, an observer – the potential applier of the CJT, interested in whether the majority outcome is correct – can usually not know how easy or misleading the problem is, hence whether the voters are competent, individually or on average. Assessing whether (Com) holds for the specific problem might even be harder than assessing the correct alternative x in the first place. p61

## Epistemic Democracy With Defensible Premises

DIETRICH & SPIEKERMANN 2013

> The contemporary theory of epistemic democracy often draws on the Condorcet Jury Theorem to formally justify the ‘wisdom of crowds’. But this theorem is inapplicable in its current form, since one of its premises – voter independence – is notoriously violated. This premise carries responsibility for the theorem’s misleading conclusion that ‘large crowds are infallible’. We prove a more useful jury theorem: under defensible premises, ‘large crowds are fallible but better than small groups’. This theorem rehabilitates the importance of deliberation and education, which appear inessential in the classical jury framework. Our theorem is related to Ladha’s (1993) seminal jury theorem for interchangeable (‘indistinguishable’) voters based on de Finetti’s Theorem. We also prove a more general and simpler such jury theorem.

> Put roughly: larger groups make better decisions, and very large groups are infallible. p88

> If the asymptotic conclusion applied directly to modern democracies with their large populations, these democracies would be essentially infallible when making decisions between two alternatives by simple majority. p88

> The CJT rests on two central premises. Stated roughly, the first premise is that the voters vote independently from each other, and the second premise is that each voter is competent, 

> Most believe that ‘something’ is wrong with Condorcet’s premises, p89

> deliberation and education may be crucial for the epistemic performance of groups, whereas the classical CJT suggests that they are inessential – since ‘crowds are infallible’ even without them – or even dangerous – since deliberation threatens voter independence.

Extentions

> For instance, Owen et al. (1989) prove that the asymptotic part also holds if judges are heterogeneous in competence, and Romeijn and Atkinson (2011) analyse cases of unknown competence. Different papers recognize that independence is hard to meet and/or prove jury theorems which weaken the independence assumption (e.g. Nitzan and Paroush 1984, Shapley and Grofman 1984, Boland 1989, Boland et al. 1989, Berg 1993, Estlund 1994, Kaniovski 2010, Spiekermann and Goodin 2012).

Problems with indepdendence

> To obtain a systematic account of voter (in)dependence, one must understand how the causal interactions in the voters’ institutional and deliberative environment create probabilistic dependence. p91

> Many different notions of objectivity are compatible with that assumption, as long as the right, correct or better answer is a fact that is determined entirely independently from the votes of the individuals. This excludes procedural notions of rightness, where the ‘right’ solution is right just because it was arrived at by applying the appropriate procedure. p91

> Condorcet anticipated a key theme of modern social choice theory: majority rule is at once a plausible method of collective decision making and yet subject to some surprising problems. Resolving or bypassing these problems remains one of social choice theory's core concerns.

Epistemic justifications of democracy

> Condorcet assumed that each individual is better than random at making a correct judgment (the competence assumption) and that different individuals' judgments are stochastically independent, given the state of the world (the independence assumption).

> Formally, let V1, V2, …, Vn (capital letters) denote the random variables generating the specific individual votes v1, v2, …, vn (small letters), and let V = f(V1, V2, …, Vn) denote the resulting random variable representing the social decision v = f(v1, v2, …, vn) under a given aggregation rule f, such as majority rule.  [X denoting the state of the world (1 or 0)]

> Condorcet's assumptions can be stated as follows:

> Competence: For each individual i ∈ N and each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, Pr(Vi = x | X = x) = p > 1/2, where p is the same across individuals and states.

> Independence: The votes of different individuals V1, V2, …, Vn are independent of each other, conditional on each value x ∈ {−1,1} of X.

> Theorem (Condorcet's jury theorem): For each state of the world x ∈ {−1,1}, the probability of a correct majority decision, Pr(V = x | X = x), is greater than each individual's probability of a correct vote, Pr(Vi = x | X = x), and converges to 1, as the number of individuals n increases.[1]


Challenging CJT Assumptions

> Although an average (not necessarily equal) individual competence above 1/2 may be sufficient for Condorcet's conclusion (e.g., Grofman, Owen, and Feld 1983; Boland 1989; Kanazawa 1998)

> The theorem's conclusion can also be undermined in less extreme cases (Berend and Paroush 1998), for instance when each individual's reliability, though above 1/2, is an exponentially decreasing function approaching 1/2 with increasing jury size (List 2003a).

> Although Condorcet's conclusion is robust to the presence of some interdependencies between individual votes, the structure of these interdependencies matters (e.g., Boland 1989; Ladha 1992; Estlund 1994; Dietrich and List 2004; Berend and Sapir 2007; Dietrich and Spiekermann 2013). If all individuals' votes are perfectly correlated with one another or mimic a small number of opinion leaders, the collective judgment is no more reliable than the judgment among a small number of independent individuals.

> Dietrich (2008) has argued that Condorcet's two assumptions are never simultaneously justified, in the sense that, even when they are both true, one cannot obtain evidence to support both at once.

> game-theoretic work challenges an implicit assumption of the jury theorem, namely that voters will always reveal their judgments truthfully...a voter expects a higher chance of bringing about a correct collective judgment by voting against his or her own private judgment than in line with it (Austin-Smith and Banks 1996; Feddersen and Pesendorfer 1998).

> Abstract: The Condorcet jury theorem (CJT) is based on the assumption of homogeneous voters who imperfectly know the correct policy. We reassess the validity of the CJT when voters are homogeneous and each knows the correct decision with an average probability of more than a half.

> The seminal Condorcet jury theorem (CJT, 1785) states that the likelihood of a cor- rect majority decision becomes certain as the group size tends to infinity. p 237


Note on relaxing assumptions:

> Early expositions and generalizations were proposed by Hoeffding (1956), Grofman (1975), Grofman et al. (1983), Feld and Grofman (1984), Nitzan and Paroush (1982, 1985), Young (1988), Owen et al. (1989), Boland (1989). Ladha (1995) and Berg (1993) relaxed the independence assumption; Austen-Smith and Banks (1996), Ben-Yashar (2006), and Ben-Yashar and Milchtaich (2007) generalized the setting to a strategic voting model; Paroush (1998) emphasized the importance of boundedness away from one-half; Berg and Paroush (1998) studied hierarchical voting. CJT can be generalized to the case of heterogeneous voters. See, for example, Ben-Yashar and Zahavi (2011), Ben-Yashar and Danziger (2011), and Berend and Paroush (1998). Ben-Yashar and Paroush (2000) generalized the non-asymptotic part of the theorem. Berend and Sapir (2005) further generalized the non-asymptotic part of the theorem beyond the analysis of Ben-Yashar and Paroush. Baharad and Ben-Yashar (2009) studied the validity of the CJT under subjective probabilities.

> One may wonder whether the CJT is valid when the average probabilities over the two possible states of nature (facing a good/bad alternative) for each voter is greater than 1/2. This study shows that, unexpectedly, the answer to this question is negative. p238-9

> Within this framework, we show that larger groups, in most cases, are less likely to reach a correct collective decision. p238

Conclusion

> This paper studies the effect of adding two members who have two probabilities of voting correctly, p1 > 1/2 in one state and p2 < 1/2 in the other. We show that such an addition, for large groups, usually results in decreasing the likelihood of reaching a correct collective decision. Our conclusion is valid even-though we assume that the average of the two probabilities of each member exceeds 1/2. Our result is surprising because the particular homogeneity assumption of Condorcet implies that the addition of members increases the probability that the group will choose the correct collective decision through majority voting. Under the generalized homogeneity assumption this is no longer the case. p240

> Abstract: This paper explores the role that difference plays in collective decision-making using the Condorcet jury theorem. Agents facing a dichotomous decision might prove biased toward one of the options facing them. That is, they may be more likely to decide correctly when one of the options is correct than when the other option is. A juror might be more likely to convict a guilty defendant than to acquit an innocent one. Agents may display opposing biases. This paper identifies the optimal committee composition in the presence of such bias. This composition depends upon both the prior probability that each option is correct and the relative costs of the two types of possible error (e.g., convicting an innocent defendant versus acquitting a guilty one). Optimal committee composition will be expressed in terms of the absolute (not relative) margin that a group with one form of bias should enjoy over the other.

> As originally formulated, the Condorcet jury theorem (CJT) demonstrates that col- lectives can outperform individuals p399

> The CJT therefore fails to capture the idea that decision-making benefits from presence of difference— that is, the involvement of a diversity of types of people, with different backgrounds, lifestyles, belief systems, etc. p400

The key idea here is how best to compose voters/juries when each member has different levels of type I and type II biases.

> This paper varies committee composition given the presence of opposing forms of bias within the population of potential committee members. Specifically, it offers a model in which opposite forms of bias are possible and then identifies the optimal composition for a committee deciding via majority rule. It thereby indicates how a committee might take maximal advantage of the presence of bias. p401

Finding

> These results provide qualified support for the idea that difference can contribute to collective decision-making. They also, however, indicate conditions necessary for this contribution to occur. Optimal decision-making involves heterogeneity only when q > 1 − p. (p406)
