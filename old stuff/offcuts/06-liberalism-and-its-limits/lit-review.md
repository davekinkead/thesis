Limits from @christiano2006

  - A limit to democratic authority is a principle violation of which defeats democratic authority.
  - "An internal limit to democratic authority is a limit that arises from the requirements of democratic process or a limit that arises from the principles that underpin democracy."
  - "An external limit on the authority of democracy is a limit that arises from principles that are independent of the values or requirements of democracy."
  - some limits are balance of reasons limits
  - others are pre-empting or undercutting

 "Locke (1690, chap. XI) gives an account of the internal limits of democracy in his idea that there are certain things to which a citizen may not consent."

 "Since democracy is founded in public equality, it may not violate public equality in any of its decisions."

 "To the extent that liberal rights are grounded in public equality and the provision of an economic minimum is also so grounded, this suggests that democratic rights and liberal rights and rights to an economic minimum create a limit to democratic authority."

 "Issues of foreign policy in general seem to give rise to possible external rebutting limits to democracy."

  An argument...
    - if democracy has no limits to it's authority, then there are no principle which defeats democratic authority
    - there are principles that defeat democratic authority
    - therefore democracy has limits.
