Over the last decade, measuring school performance has become the activity _de rigueur_ for those in charge of our education systems.  Parents want to know which school will best educate their children; principals want to know if their leadership makes a difference; politicians and bureaucrats want to know if their policies work and public resources are invested appropriately.  Today, most developed countries have some metric to do measure and compare school performance -- Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) of No Child Left Behind (NCLB), Progress 8 scores, National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN), Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA).

And why shouldn't it be?  Quality education is a key source of human capital, a critical driver of a country's international competitiveness in a global knowledge economy, and perhaps more importantly --- essential for a properly functioning society.  Every year we spend billions of dollars, pounds, and yuan in educating our children in kindergarten, school, and university, with much of this investment publicly funded.  Ensuring that scarce public funds are well spent is therefore a moral imperative --- and accurately measuring school performance an essential capability [^def-performance].

[^def-performance]: I use the term _school performance_ here to broadly describe the causal impact that pedagogy, education policy, or even build environment has on student achievement.

Yet despite our desire to do so, measuring school performance isn't easy.  Broadly speaking, we can measure school performance in two ways: by the things schools do -- the practices, pedagogies, and processes they apply; or by the things schools produce -- the academic achievement of students, university or employment placement, or even perhaps by the quality of well-rounded citizens they produce.  Of these measures however, it is the latter that has come the most prevalent, especially via standardised literacy and numeracy tests.

Measuring school performance by student achievement however, faces a significant epistemic challenge.  The relationship between schooling and student outcomes is a causal one.  Because we can't measure the causal impact of schooling on student achievement directly, we can't know this causal impact with certainty.  Instead, we must _infer_ the causal impact of schooling on student achievement by way of proxy measures such as standardised student test scores.  If student achievement improve, then we can _infer_ that some aspect of schooling _caused_ this.

Perhaps.

Just how warranted is this inference from student achievement to school performance?  The challenges associated with inferring school performance from student achievement have long been documented [@coleman1970] yet doing so remains popular.  This is understandable - measuring school performance via student acheivement is much easier than assessing fidelity with particular practices and in some circumstances, the inference is warranted.  But when school choice is available, whether by giving families a choice in the school their children attend or schools admitting students selectively, the inference from student acheivement to school performance breaks down.

Using computer simulation, I develop a simple model in order to investigate the robustness of the inference from student achievement to school performance.  I then demonstrate how the introduction of school choice leads to a complete failure of the inference mechanism.  My argument is simple - _if an inference is unreliable in an ideal setting, then it is certainly unreliable in a non-ideal one_.  By eliminating measurement errors and abstracting away confounders, computer simulation allows us to create the ideal conditions from which to assess the quality of this inference.  Thus, if the conditions in this model are present in the real world, then we should be very sceptical inferring anything about school performance from student achievement.

If the conditions of the computer model are present in real life, if school choice is available, then we should be very skeptical infering from student achievement to performance from .


## Measuring School Performance

There are a variety of ways we might measure school performance.  One way is to _measure the things schools do_ -- the practices, pedagogies, and processes they apply.  If their application of a process is faithful to some standard, then we might judge them to be performing well.  If not, then we judge them poorly.  But a more common approach is to _measure the things schools produce_ -- how many students qualified for university, how many found well paying jobs, or especially how well students performed in tests.

However we measure the academic achievement of students -- whether by _declarative knowledge_, the learning and appropriate recall of particular facts; or by _procedural knowledge_, the application of skill and know-how -- we have an abundance of existing data available to us and the tools needed to obtain more are relatively easy to administer -- standardised literacy and numeracy tests like NAPLAN; the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [@dunn1965]; IQ scores or the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) [@wechsler2003].  Measuring educational outputs is much simpler than measuring processes. Yet the metrics from these tools are just proxies for what we really want to know --- what is the educational impact of schooling upon students?   

Accurately measuring school performance by proxies however, is hard.  The challenges associated with inferring school performance from student achievement have long been documented. Ecological models, for example, stress the important role non-school factors like family and neighbourhood have on student performance [@bronfenbrenner1994, @zubrick2000].  Further clouding our understanding are the often competing causal theories that attempt to explain how schools affect student achievement - peer effect [@hanushek2003], class size policies [@ehrenberg2001], or teacher training and qualifications [@kosgei2013].  How and to what degree schools themselves impact student achievement remains an open question. How much the changes in student achievement can be attributed to school performance is therefore, also uncertain.  

Measuring school performance is hard because measuring causation is hard.  The limits of causal knowledge have been well documented in science and philosophy.  Causation cannot be observed directly -- it can't be seen, heard, or touched.  Neither can it be known _a priori_.  Causal claims might be true or false, but they are never contradictory [@hume1748 ยง4.2.16].  Instead, causal connections must be _inferred_ from their observable, posited effects.  In order to discover the causes of effects, we try to hold all but a few variables fixed, and observe the covariance between them in order to identify causality.  

In complex systems accurate causal inferences are especially challenging.  Common causes, feedback loops, under-determination, over-determination, and causal indeterminacy all strain the certainty of our inference mechanisms despite the best controls, protocols, and experimental design we might put in place.  Causal inference is difficult.  Inferring the causal impact of a school on student achievement in a complex education system with multiple confounders is especially difficult.  Yet infer it we must.  So an important question we need to ask is _just how warranted is this inference from student achievement to school performance_? 

In some scenarios, inferring school performance from student achievement might be perfectly justified.  Changes in student achievement might be largely or even wholly explainable by a school's causal impact.  In these instances, when students results improve, we can justifiably say that because the school's causal impact is largely responsible, the school performance has improved.  In many other scenarios however, we might have serious grounds for scepticism.  Confounders such as parental age and socio-economic status [@caro2009], birth weight, neighbourhood characteristics [@nghiem2015], or even a student's breakfast consumption [@adolphus2013] might explain a great deal about differences in student achievement.  In these cases, when the extent of a school's causal impact is uncertain, then we should question whether we can infer anything at all about school performance from changes in student achievement.

If inferring from observable effects to their causes is difficult, then judging the quality of the inference mechanism is even harder.  Doing so requires some standard against which we can make comparisons but our knowledge of this standard is limited by the same problem of inference.  If we could somehow know independently the causal impact of schools upon students, then we could judge the qualify of our inference from empiric data.  But how can we judge the quality of the inference from student achievement to school performance if we can't be certain what is the cause of student achievement in the first place?  We lack the epistemological foundations to properly ground our second order judgements.

This is a problem that empiric approaches cannot overcome. If we are to use empiric data from student achievement to make causal inferences about school performance, then we can't use that same data to judge the quality of the causal inference mechanism.  If however, we are to use the same empiric data to judge the quality of the inference, then we need to already know the cause - but if we already knew the cause, we wouldn't need to infer school performance via the proxy of student achievement in the first place.  We need another way.


## Methodology

Computer simulation offers us one way out of this problem. Simulation allows us to not only model how we think the world _is_, but to also specify how we think the world _should be_.  It allows us to know the causal relationships _within_ the model with certainty because they are explicitly stipulated in code _ex ante_.  With causality known by stipulation _a priori_, we can then observe the empiric data the simulation generates _a posteriori_ and assess the quality of the inference mechanism. We can judge how good the inference mechanism from student achievement to school performance really is - in our model at least.

The purpose of this simulation is therefore not to explain or predict the real world but to create a yard stick by which we can judge our causal inferences in the real world.  The model simplifies and abstracts away all possible confounding causes of student performance.  Importantly, it eliminates any errors when measuring student performance and stipulates that schooling is the _only_ cause of changes in student performance [^note-only].  This creates ideal conditions for assessing the quality of our second order judgements - the inference from student achievement to school performances.

[^note-only]: Again, the claim is not that schooling is the only causal factor in student performance in the _real world_, but that it is the only causal factor in the model because it has been programmed as such.

Because the causal impact of a school on student achievement in a simulation is known by stipulation, we can assess how accurately empiric data about student achievement maps to the stipulated causal impact of the school --- to our belief about school performance.  If the inference mechanism from student result to school performance is warranted in the simulation when the causal mechanism is known by stipulation, then we have some grounds to be confident about the inference mechanism in the real world, additional confounders not withstanding.  _But if the inference isn't warranted when the causal mechanism is known, then it can't be warranted when the causal mechanism is unknown._  This simulation will therefore allow us to say when the student result to school performance inference _might_ be warranted, and when it _cannot be_ warranted.  It will give us a yard stick against which we can judge _possibly_ or _definately not_.


## A Model of School Performance

We begin by defining a model of students.  Students have a level of academic achievement measured from a minimum of `0.0` to a maximum of `1.0`.  Academic achievement is broadly construed and can be interpreted as any attribute of value that can be influenced by schooling.  This achievement is randomly generated with a uniform distribution and is centred around a mean of `0.5`.


    class Student
      constructor: () ->
        @achievement = Math.random()


Next we model schools.  Schools are collections of students upon whose acheivement they causally impact.  In short, _schools teach students_.  The causal impact of a school on a student's academic performance ranges from `-1.0` (a strong negative impact) to `1.0` (a strong positive impact).  This impact is the same for all students and is fixed for the duration of the simulation.  Again, no claim is made about how educational impact is transmitted to student achievement in the real world.  Policy, pedagogy, or the school environment are all possible causal mechanisms compatible with this model.  The key stipulation is that `impact` is the _only_ causal mechanism at work.


    class School
      constructor: (@id, @impact) ->


Finally, we create a class to encapsulate the simulation itself.  We will construct each simulations with a profile describing the desired attributes of the schools and student distribution.  We then create 1000 students of random achievement and assign them in the schools according to the stipulated profile.  The initial assignment of students between schools is determined by a skew factor ranging from `0.0` (all students of below average achievement are in the first school) to `1.0` (all students of above average achievement students are in the first school).  The default value of `0.5` results in an even distribution of students by achievement.  Subsequent enrolments will be random.


    class Simulation
      constructor: (@profile) ->
        @schools = for school, id in @profile.schools
          new School(id, school.impact)
        @students = [1..1000].map () =>
          student = new Student()
          student.school = randomly_assign(student, @schools, @profile.skew)
          student


The initial assignment of students between schools is determined by a skew factor ranging from `0.0` (all students of below average achievement are in the first school) to `1.0` (all students of above average achievement students are in the first school).  The default value of `0.5` results in an even distribution of students by achievement.  Subsequent enrolments will be random.


    randomly_assign = (student, schools, skew=0.5) ->
      [first, second] = if student.achievement > 0.5 then [0,1] else [1,0]
      if Math.random() < skew then schools[first] else schools[second]


Events in the simulation will occur during a generic time period called a `tick`.  A tick can represent any fixed period of time such as a term, semester, or year.  During each tick schools will `teach` students, some students will `graduate`, and some new students will `enrol`.


    Simulation::tick = () ->
      @teach()
      @graduate()
      @enrol()


Schools causally impact a student's achievement.  Schools teach and students learn.  Again, the actual causal mechanism the model describes could be a variety of influences such as pedagogy, policy, or classroom environment.  As a non-ecological model however, schooling is the _only_ mechanism by which student achievement can change within the model.  The causal impact on student achievement is assumed to be linear and a constraint is applied to ensure achievement remains between `0.0` and `1.0`.


    Simulation::teach = () ->
      transference=0.2
      @students.forEach (student) ->
        student.achievement = student.achievement * (student.school.impact * transference + 1)
        student.achievement = Math.min student.achievement, 1.0


During each tick, a percentage of students will graduate and be replaced by new students enrolling.  We will set the graduation rate at 20% per tick.


    Simulation::graduate = (graduation_rate=0.2) ->
      @graduates = @students.filter (student) ->
        Math.random() < graduation_rate


Depending on the _selectivity_ parameter, some students will attempt to enrol in the perceived best performing school.  If more than half of the total students are attempting to enrol in one particular school, the school will select the highest achieving students first so that all schools have roughly even numbers of students.


    Simulation::enrol = () ->
      [best, worst] = @rank_schools()

      @graduates.forEach (student) =>
        student.achievement = Math.random()
        if Math.random() < @profile.selectivity
          student.school = if student.achievement > 0.5 
          then @schools[best.id] 
          else @schools[worst.id]        


Identifying the 'best' school requires us to rank schools based on student performance so we create a simple league table that all students have knowledge of.


    Simulation::rank_schools = () ->
      @measure_schools()
      [best, worst] = if @schools[0].score > @schools[1].score
      then [@schools[0], @schools[1]]
      else [@schools[1], @schools[0]]


Measuring school performance is then done by calculating the average student achievement in each school.  This acts as an error free method of student assessment which removes concerns about measurement validation from the model.  School performance will therefore perfectly track the academic achievement of the students enrolled.


    Simulation::measure_schools = () ->
      @schools.map (school) =>
        students = @students.filter (student) ->
          student.school.id is school.id
        total = students.map (student) ->
            student.achievement
          .reduce (prev, curr) ->
            prev + curr
        school.score = total / students.length
    

We now have a complete model of students with initial uniformly random `achievement`; schools whose stipulated `impact` is the only mechanism for affecting student achievement; a perfect measure of school performance as average student achievement; methods for some student to graduate and new ones to enrol; and a means of varying how much _selectivity_ is present in the school system as well as the initial _skew_ of above average students.  In short, we have created _perfect conditions_ for measuring school performance.


## Simulations

With the model defined, we begin with a test to ensure the code is working as expected and ground our confidence in the simulation.  We will begin with students split evenly between the two schools.  We stipulate that schools have no causal impact on student achievement, and that there is no selectivity within the system.  Because enrolment is completely random and there is no causal impact from schools, what we _should_ observe is no significant change within and between schools.  

The movement in the simulation visually represents a `tick`.  Student achievement is represented in colour - blue for > `0.5` and red for < `0.5` achievement.  The profile of the simulation is expressed in the code below and the simulation can be started or stopped by clicking on it.  


    sanity_check_1 = { 
      schools: [{impact: 0.0}, {impact: 0.0}],
      selectivity: 0.0
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="sanity-check-1"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 1: No impact, no selectivity.</figcaption></figure>

Running the simulation generates the expected results. During each tick, the `teach` method has no impact on student achievement because both schools have `0.0` impact. Some students graduate and are replaced with new students of random achievement.  As such, school performance, measured by average student achievement, remains close to 0.5.

Next, we will model two schools with different causal impact - one positive and one negative - but again with no selectivity.  While both schools will start with similar student achievement levels, the `teach` method _should_ see student achievement in the first school increase while it decreases in the second. 


    sanity_check_2 = { 
      schools: [{impact: 0.5}, {impact: -0.5}],
      selectivity: 0.0
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="sanity-check-2"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 2: School impact, no selectivity.</figcaption></figure>

Again, the simulation generates the expected results with one school's performance stabilising at approximately `0.66` and the other at `0.33`.  In both cases, the simulation performed as expected and our inference from student achievement to school performance is warranted.  In these scenarios we can reliably infer school performance from student achievement.


## School Performance as Shifting Averages

Most schools systems have some degree of selectivity.  This might be selectivity on the part of the school where only the top achieving students are admitted; or it might be selectivity on the part of the students or parents who explicity choose one school over another.  Selectivity can also be implicit when for example, parents choose a 'good' neighbourhood with 'good' schools to live in.

 In the next scenario, we take parameters from Simulation 1 where schools have no causal impact on student achievement, but introduce selectivity into the model.  Because both schools are identical in terms of their causal impact, and school `impact` is the only causal mechanism in the model, _any changes in school performance must be the result of selectivity_.


    shifting_averages = { 
      schools: [{impact: 0.0}, {impact: 0.0}],
      selectivity: 0.5
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="shifting-averages"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 3: No impact but with selectivity.</figcaption></figure>

While the performance of both schools is approximately `0.5` when the simulation begins, any minor imbalance in relative performance caused by random variation in new student achievement results in a run-away effect.  As soon as one school is perceived to perform better than others, _selectivity_ ensures that students who do selectively enrol, choose the school with the higher percentage of high achievement students.  After a few ticks, the simulation stabilises with one school performing at approximate `0.63` and the other at `0.37`.

Recall however that the impact of schools is stipulated as zero - both schools are identical.  Individual student achievement never changes because schools have no impact in this scenario.  The large differences in school performance are therefore completely explained by _selectivity_.  As selectivity and the percentage of students enrolling non-randomly increases, so too does the performance difference.  Differences in school performance as measured by student achievement are the result of nothing more than shifting averages of student achievement.  When selectivity is present, the inference from student achievement to school performance is unreliable.


## Performance is Relative

The previous simulation showed how significant performance differences can arise even when schools are causally identical.  The next simulations demonstrate how a school with a low or negative impact can appear to perform well above what it should.  We begin with two schools having differing levels of negative impact but with no selectivity.  In this case the average performance of both schools _should_ decrease, propped up only by new enrolments whose average achievement is `0.5`.


    relative_1 = { 
      schools: [{impact: -0.25}, {impact: -0.5}],
      selectivity: 0.0
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="relative-1"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 4: Negative impact, no selectivity.</figcaption></figure>

Again, the simulation results are as expected.  Both schools performed poorly but the school with the lowest causal impact performed the worst.  Next however, we introduce selectivity to the same schools and students.


    relative_2 = { 
      schools: [{impact: -0.25}, {impact: -0.5}],
      selectivity: 0.5
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="relative-2"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 5: Negative impact with selectivity.</figcaption></figure>

When selectivity is present, the inference from student achievement and school performance breaks down again.  The school with the negative but better causal impact performs far better than its causal impact says it should - increasing average student achievement from `0.4` in Simulation 4 to `0.5` in Simulation 5.  Meanwhile, the school with the worst causal impact performs much worse than it should - decreasing average student achievement from `0.33` to `0.22`.  The schools remained the same in both simulations.  The only change in the simulations, and therefore only causal of the change, was the introduction of selectivity.

As selectivity increases, so too does the disconnect between perceived performance and causal impact. The mere presence of a school with lower causal impact on student achievement combined with selectivity results in the higher achievement students enrolling in the _least worst_ school, thereby _inflating_ that school's apparent performance.  Thus, school performance as measured by student achievement is determined not only by the causal impact of a school but also by the relative performance of other schools.  This is not to say that school performance _is_ relative, but rather that the performance of one school is affected by the performance of another, whenever selectivity is present.  Again, the inference from student achievement to school performance is unreliable.


## Initial Conditions Matter

In an egalitarian utopia, every child would have the same opportunities as every other.  The biological lottery wouldn't affect educational outcomes.  Obviously, this is not our reality -- initial conditions matter.  Until now, we have looked at scenarios where both schools started with similar initial random distributions of students.  In the next simulations, we add a new parameter, `skew`, that alters the initial enrolment of students.  
We continue with the same 1000 students of random achievement (mean `0.5`) but set the initial distribution between schools.  A `skew` value of `0.75` here means that 75% of the above average, and therefore only 25% of the below average students, will initially be enrolled in the first school.  The default value of `0.5` means there is an equal distribution of achievement.

In the next simulation, we stipulate that schools have different causal impact but the initial distribution of student achievement is skewed in favour of the school with the lowest impact.  No selectivity is present so we should expect the initial mismatch between school impact and performance to be corrected over time.


    head_start_1 = { 
      schools: [{impact: -0.25}, {impact: 0.25}],
      selectivity: 0.0,
      skew: 0.75
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="head-start-1"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 6: Mixed impact with skew.</figcaption>
</figure>

As expected, any imbalance in the initial distribution when selectivity is absent is eliminated given enough time.  In each tick, the causal impact of schools affects student achievement, and every enrolling cohort normalises school performance to a degree.  The first school, while appearing to perform strongest initially, eventually performs poorly, with the opposite occurring in the second school.  

Next, we add selectivity to the same parameters and see how this changes performance.


    head_start_2 = { 
      schools: [{impact: -0.25}, {impact: 0.25}],
      selectivity: 0.5,
      skew: 0.75
    }


<figure class="simulation">
<div id="head-start-2"></div>
<figcaption>Simulation 7: Mixed impact with skew and selection.</figcaption></figure>

Again, when selectivity is present school performance no longer reflects a school's stipulated causal impact.  A skewed initial distribution of students and selectivity results in a school with a negative causal impact performing better than a school with a postive causal impact.  Given a sufficiently skewed initial distribution, schools with negative causal impact can continue to outperform schools with positive impact.  Yet again, the presence of selectivity in the school system undermines the student achievement to school performance inference mechanism.


## Discussion

Measuring school performance is important but we cannot measure it directly.  Instead, we typically rely on student achievement as a proxy, and _infer_ school performance.  This of course, raises a number of epistemic challenges.  Few people if any would claim that current school performance measurement regimes that rely on student achievement as proxy data from standardised tests such as NAPLAN are perfect.  What these simulations demonstrate however, is that _if selectivity is present, then the inference from student achievement to school performance is unwarranted_.  If a causal inference mechanism isn't warranted when causes are known with certainty, then it seems highly impausible that the inference can be warranted when causes aren't known or observable.  

The inference from student achievement to school performance is poor even under the very best epistemic conditions.  The model above allows us to stipulate the behaviour of much that is uncontrollable in the real world.  Within the model, our knowledge of student achievement is perfect and not affected by test errors, strategic teaching, or exam stress.  So too is our knowledge of the causal mechanism.  As a non-ecological model, we have stipulated that the only what student achievement can change in the simulation is via school impact.  We could not ask for more perfect conditions from which to _infer_ causal impact yet even here the link between proxy evidence and actual cause breaks down.  _We should therefore be very skeptical about inferring school performance from student achievement_.

This is of course, a purely theoretical argument.  It remains an open empiric question just how well the simulation models reality, and how much selectivity occurs within our school systems.  Social scientists are likely to be better placed answering this question than philosophers are, but a few observations about the Australian context are germane.  Approximately 35% of all students currently attend a non-government school [@abs2014] indicating a minimum level of explicit selectivity.  Then there is selectivity within government schools.  Data on what percentage of students attend their _nearest_ school is difficult to find, as is data on parents moving to different school catchment zones because of perceived school performance, but anecdotal evidence suggests this too occurs.

One might object to my conclusion by claiming that the model described doesn't accurately reflect the real world.  This is certainly true but not grounds to reject the conclusion.  All models are abstractions and simplifications of reality - that is their strength.  In this case, the model described presents a best case epistemic scenario for measuring school performance.  As such, the simplification of the model _strengthens_ the claims for epistemic skepticism towards school performance.

Despite its simplicity, the model also appears to conform with empiric observation.  In the sanity check simulations, the model performed exactly as expected.  When selectivity was introduced, the simulation was compatible with recent Australian data. @nghiem2015 analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children showed that non-government (and therefore selectively enrolled) schools had higher average student NAPLAN results but once controlled, performed equally or worse in the case of Catholic schools.

Some might also simply dispute my claim that student achievement are typically used for measuring school performance.  NAPLAN, Peabody, and Wechsler tests are intended for measuring student, not school performance.  Longitudinal [@zubrick2000], predictive [@lavin1965], and psychological studies of academic performance [@pintrich1990] all rely on these measures without making claims about school performance.  In short, they might argue that my conclusion may be entailed but that it is poorly targeted.  While it is certainly true that student achievement are used for much more than assessing school performance, student achievement are still used to infer school performance by parents, teachers, and policy makers alike.  NAPLAN is explicit on this - "[s]chools can gain detailed information about how they are performing, and they can identify strengths and weaknesses which may warrant further attention." [@naplan2015]

The impact of student intake and composition has long been acknowledged to play an important role in determining school performance [@thrupp1995, @thrupp1999, @thrupp2006].  What this simulation so graphically demonstrates is how these common scenarios further complicate research into school performance by undermining our inference mechanisms even in ideal settings.  _We should be very skeptical about inferring school performance from student achievement_.

This article is written in Literate Coffeescript.  Literate programming has a great deal to offer the humanities, not least of which is that it makes replication available to all readers.  To build the simulation from the raw paper, download the project from [the repo](https://github.com/blind-review/school-performance) and type `make paper` in the command line.  Make sure you've got [Coffeescript](http://Coffeescript.org/) and [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) installed first.

Running a simulation with your own parameters is easy.  You just need to specify the parameters and call `display(target-location, parameters)` and add a target location in HTML `id="target-location"`


## Browser Code

Much of the browser code required in this simulation is not germane to the argument and so has been extracted here to the appendix.  It provided here so that the entire simulation is self contained within the paper itself.  

To make things look pretty, we will use the [D3.js data visualisation library](http://d3js.org/) by Mike Bostock.  We will also set some global variables from the browser such as height and width.


    d3      = require 'd3'
    width   = window.innerWidth || 600
    height  = width * 0.4


Because we will be running multiple simulations in the browser, we will need a way of creating different ones.  Here we define a `display` method for creating a simulation and binding it to a canvas with click events.  When a simulation canvas is clicked, the interval runner starts and calls the `tick` method every 1000 milliseconds.


    display = (id, params) =>
      runner = false
      simulation = new Simulation params
      canvas = d3.select("##{id}")
        .append("svg:svg")
        .attr "height", "auto"
        .attr "width", width
        .attr "preserveAspectRatio", "xMidYMid meet"
        .attr "viewBox", "0 0 #{width} #{Math.max(width * 0.4, height * 0.8)}"
        .on "click", () ->
          if runner
            clearInterval runner
            runner = false
          else 
            runner = setInterval () ->
              tick simulation
            , 1000
      canvas.append('text')
        .attr "y", () -> height * .85
        .attr "x", () -> width * .33


In every tick cycle, we run call simulation's `teach` and `graduate` methods.  We then `render` the simulation to calculate the x & y coordinates for the students, and update the canvas.  


      tick = (simulation) ->
        simulation.tick()
        render simulation
        draw canvas.selectAll "circle"        


We then `draw` the students on the canvas.  We will represent our students as coloured circles and schools by student proximity.  We will also append the school averages in text form.


      draw = (students) ->
        students.transition()
          .duration 1000
          .style "fill", (d) -> colour d, 'achievement'
          .style "opacity", 0.5
          .attr "r", 8
          .attr "cx", (d) -> d.x
          .attr "cy", (d) -> d.y
        canvas.select "text"
          .text "#{simulation.schools[0].score.toFixed(5)} 
            - Average Student achievement 
            - #{simulation.schools[1].score.toFixed(5)}" 


Finally, we setup the initial rendering.


      setup = () ->
        render simulation
        students = canvas.selectAll "circle"
          .data simulation.students
        students.enter()
          .append "circle"
          .style "fill", (student) ->
            colour student, 'achievement'
          .style "opacity", 0.5
          .attr "r", 8
          .attr "cx", (d) -> d.x
          .attr "cy", (d) -> d.y 
                     
      setup()


In the browser code above, we have relied on a few helper methods.  The first of these represents student achievement graphically using colour.  Blue represents high achievement and red low achievement.  With a little bit of maths, we can convert achievement on a range of 0.0 to 1.0 to a hexadecimal representation of Red-Green-Blue colour.


    colour = (d, attribute) ->
      red = Math.floor( (1-d[attribute])*255 ).toString 16
      blue = Math.floor( d[attribute]*255   ).toString 16
      red = "0#{red}" if red.length is 1
      blue = "0#{blue}" if blue.length is 1 
      "##{red}00#{blue}"


To display students and indicate school enrolment by student proximity, we create a Gaussian overlay so all students in the same school clump together.  Each student is assigned a randomised position centred on their school.


    render = (simulation) ->
      simulation.schools.map (school) ->
        school.x = width * (0.3 + 0.5 * school.id)
        school.y = height * 0.6
      simulation.students.map (student) ->
        student.x = gausian(width/1.2) + student.school.x
        student.y = gausian(height/0.5) + student.school.y

    gausian = (range) ->
      Math.random()*range/8 + Math.random()*range/8 + Math.random()*range/8 - range/4


Finally, we trigger the various simulations outlined in the article once all the scripts have loaded.


    window.onload = () ->
      display 'sanity-check-1', sanity_check_1
      display 'sanity-check-2', sanity_check_2
      display 'shifting-averages', shifting_averages
      display 'relative-1', relative_1
      display 'relative-2', relative_2
      display 'head-start-1', head_start_1
      display 'head-start-2', head_start_2
