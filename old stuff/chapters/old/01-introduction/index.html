<p>Computers are ubiquitous in our lives today. Computer networks allow us to connect and communicate with billions of people around the planet in milliseconds. This connectedness is transforming they way people work. For some, that means working remotely from a beach in Thailand or a ski slope in Austria. For others, this connectedness is eroding job security as many functions from accounting to radiology are being outsourced to regions with lower wage costs. Whether positive or negative computers are transforming the way we work today.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, computational approaches to investigation are also becoming more common place in academia. Computational biologists use computers to simulate biological and social systems. Computational linguists use computers to develop statistical models of language structures. Computational physicists use computers to derive numerical approximations of complex physical phenomena. And computational philosophers use computers to ... well, there really aren't any computational philosophers.</p>
<p>The way these disciplines use computers is what makes them <em>computational</em>. The use of digital devices is far more than the streamlining and augmenting of existing analogy processes -- replacing typing with word processing, or print with digital distribution of journals. Instead, computational disciplines use digital <em>methodologies</em>. They perform scholarship in ways that wouldn't be possible without computers.</p>
<p>Yet within the academy, philosophy remains a digital laggard. The use of mathematics and proof has long been part of analytic philosophy at least but the use of computer modelling and simulation is only nascent. Computational philosophy as a disciple does not yet exist.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate for philosophy because there are many areas of the disciple, especially political, moral, and social philosophy, that could benefit from embracing computational approaches. Political philosophy for example, involves the study of complex systems with emergent properties like human societies and economies. As such, experimental data is difficult to observe and causal inferences are difficult to make. Unlike the physical sciences, the social scientist and philosopher cannot hold variables fixed, make precise interventions, or re-run experiments with ease.</p>
<p>It is here that computational approaches to philosophy can help. It can overcome the existing epistemic limitations found in traditional philosophy methods - analytic intractability, the inability to experiment, and the challenge of complexity and emergent behaviour.</p>
<p>Segway to political philosophy</p>
<p>What are the key problems in democracy - making causal claims</p>
<p>This thesis proposes and attempts to justify a new computational methodology for philosophy - <em>argumentum in silico</em>.</p>
<p>This thesis is both an argument for greater use of computational methods in philosopy, as well as a demonstration of how it can be used. In the proceding chapters, I offer multiple examples of computational approaches to political philosophy, each one a challenge to the claims of democratic authority.</p>
<p>This is also, I believe, the world's first computer executable philosophy thesis.</p>
<p>Here's what I think my thesis could look like.....</p>
<h2 id="philsophy-method">Philsophy &amp; Method</h2>
<h2 id="democracy-and-borders">Democracy and Borders</h2>
<p>Many accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes. Democracy brings about good things. These outcomes might be judged according to some content independent criteria - that say, democracy tracks the truth. They might be judged according to some content relative criteria - that democracy maximises individual preferences. Or they might be judged according to some content-indifferent criteria - that democracy improves the moral character of its citizens.</p>
<p>The outcomes of these processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes. Including different people amongst <em>the people</em> can change the outcome of the democratic process. Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome. Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different. How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.</p>
<p>Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is. The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history. There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state). For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions). And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas. Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.</p>
<p>Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters. Different borders will produce different results, and different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion. Content independent justifications of democracy like Condorcet's or Estlund's for example, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection. Without this diversity within polities, democracy has no epistemic value.</p>
<p>Content-relative justifications of democracy like preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value. They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion). These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion. Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.</p>
<p>The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion. That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress. Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.</p>
<p>Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help. Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another. Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this. But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes. This however only says what is necessary for <em>any</em> political association.</p>
<p>The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter. This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi. A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones. Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones. And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.</p>
<p>Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be. Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.</p>
<h2 id="states-of-nature">States of Nature</h2>
<p>So far I've demonstrated that a number of justications of democracy are unsatisfactory. That their premises don't entail their conclusion, that additional conditions found in actual democracy's undermine their conclusions, or simply that their premises are incompatible with each other.</p>
<p>Yet even if these charges that I level stick, they may not be fatal. That's because even though these instrumental justifications of democracy may no longer be sufficient to justificy democratic authority, they may still demonstrate that democracy has <em>some</em> value.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time.<br />-- Winston Churchill</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Churchill's quip points out, simply because democracy is not perfect, doesn't mean it lacks value. By itself, an account of democracy may be insufficient to entail the justification of democratic authority. If however, we reject the anarchist view that a state isn't essential, then we now have a vialble justification.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The state's authority is necessary</li>
<li>Democracy is the least worst form of government</li>
<li>Therefore democratic authority is justified.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most famous justification of the authority of the state then, would have to be Hobbe's Leviathan. In it, he offers us a complex yet subtle argument for why it is rational people to submit to absolute power. Men, Hobbes claims, share similar desires, the most fundamental of which is self-presevation. But the goods that ensure self-presevation are scares which leads to competition. Competition leads to conflict, as some men seek to take from others, which in turn leads to distrust. As there are no moral constraints upon the pursuit of self-presevation in the state of nature, the rational man strikes first. Power becomes the currency of self-presevation - both to protect oneself from others and advance one's own aims. Compounding this arms race for more power is the presence of vainglorious men who seek power for its own sake, requiring even men of modest desires to pursue power in response.</p>
<p>Competition, distrust, and glory means that the state of nature is a war of all against all where life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. Cooperation in the state of nature is <em>impossible</em>, and the only path out is but submitting to an absolute sovereign. Absolute authority is <em>necessary</em>.</p>
<p>Hobbes has been called the <em>proto-game theorist</em> of politics. His description of the state of nature has distinct similarities to the mathematics of the Prisoner's Dilemma and assurance games like the Stag Hunt. Unsurprisingly, analysing Hobbes' Leviathan using game theory has become popular with contemporary political philosophers. Despite the significant body of work however, the current literature is divided among many issues - what is the best game for analysing the argument? Is the problem conflict or the emergence of coventants? And how accurately do these games describe Hobbes' arguments.</p>
<p>In this chapter I take a different approach. By using a evolutionary causal model, I demonstrate that usign game theory to model Hobbe's argument results in either a valid argument with implausible premises or plausible premises with an invalid form.</p>
<h2 id="school-performance">School Performance</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people would accept the claim that schooling somehow affects student achievement. After all, as a society we invest significant amounts of time and money in various endeavours trying to measure exactly this. Measuring the impact of schooling on student achievement however, faces a significant epistemic challenge. Because we can't measure the causal impact of schooling on student achievement directly, we can't know this causal impact with certainty. Instead, we <em>infer</em> the causal impact of schooling on student achievement by way of proxy measures such as student results. If student results improve, then we can <em>infer</em> that some aspect of schooling <em>caused</em> this...perhaps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How warranted is this inference from student results to school performance? With the aid of computer simulation, I investigate the robustness of this inference mechanism in a variety of common scenarios. By eliminating errors and abstracting away confounders, computer simulation allows us to create the ideal conditions from which to assess the quality of this inference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I show that under a variety of common scenarios, the inference from student results to school performance is not warranted - even under ideal conditions. Because if we can't infer school performance reliably in ideal conditions, then we certainly can't do so in the non-ideal conditions of the real world. This article advances the literature by demonstrating in inherent difficulty, and perhaps even pointlessness, of trying to infer <em>school performance from student results</em>.</p>

<p>And that's that. I may have to change the authority stuff to democracy but why not?</p>

<p>Cut this below...</p>
<h2 id="a-new-challenge-to-the-jury-theorem">A New Challenge to the Jury Theorem</h2>
<p>This chapter introduces a new challenge to the Jury Theorem. Condorcet's Jury Theorem (CJT) proves that the likelihood of a simple majority vote on some issue being correct increases to certainty as the number of voters increases to infinity, assuming that the average voter competence is better than 50%.</p>
<p>Demonstrating that the assumption of voter competence holds true in real life proves difficult however. Ascertaining voter competence empirically requires some independent way of determining the what correct choice is in actual fact. Yet if this can be known independently, using CJT to justify democracy becomes redundant. Instead, voter competence is simply presumed by appealing to the the Principle of Charity. After all, if randomly flipping a coin yields at 50% likelihood of being correct on a binary issue, the addition of even a modicum of reason should increase that likelihood at least a little.</p>
<p>Using computer simulation, I advance Goodin &amp; Estlund's argument for the persuasiveness of democratic majorities and show that diversity of voter competence undermines the Principle of Charity. To have any plausibility, the PoC should apply equally to indistinguishable polities. This is not the case however. Even if the assumptions of CJT hold true for one polity, it is unlikely they hold true for other indistinguishable polities. Thus, we have even less reason to support the Principle of Charity than previously thought.</p>
<p>(Alternatively, I show whenever choices about inclusion need to be made, CDT assumptions don't necessarily hold internally even when they are true externally.)</p>
<h2 id="egalitarianism-and-inequality">Egalitarianism and Inequality</h2>
<p>Some justifications of democracy are egalitarian. According to these accounts, democracy has value because it embodies political equality.</p>
<p>But <em>equality</em> is one of those essentially contested terms and a great deal hinges on exactly which conception of equality democracy requires. One important distinction when considering equality is thinking of it as either <em>procedurally</em> or <em>substantively</em>.</p>
<p>Procedural equality requires treating relevant people the same. It is an agent-blind conception that doesn't make distinctions between agents and treats everyone the same.</p>
<p>Substantive equality, by contrast, requires that a process actually realises equality. It permits treating different people differently in order to achieve equality.</p>
<p>Yet procedural equality is too weak a concept to do the necessary normative work of legitimating democracy. Why should we care if a process treats people the same when it doesn't actually <em>realise</em> political equality? If it is actual equality that matters, then we must focus of substantive equality.</p>
<p>In this paper, I want to explore the relationship between procedural and substantive equality and answer the question: 'Under what conditions does procedural equality map substantive equality, and under what conditions does it not?'.</p>
<p>I will then attempt to demonstrate that egalitarian justifications of democratic authority fail under normal conditions because they cannot reliably produce egalitarian outcomes.</p>
<p>To do this, I'm going to create a computer model of a simple democracy with procedural equality and measure it's substantive equality for a range of parameters.</p>
<p>The model consists of agents who hold stipulated preferences <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, etc, and who all exist in a single polity.</p>
<p>First, we model three democratic processes that have procedural equality:</p>
<ul>
<li>unanimity voting</li>
<li>majority voting</li>
<li>sortition</li>
</ul>
<p>In the voting processes, agents have an equal vote and vote naively according to their preference. Under sortition, agents have an equiprobable chance of having their preference selected.</p>
<p>We then measure the substantive equality that the democratic processes realise over a range of parameter variable in a Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 trials. In each trial, agents are created with preferences based on stipulated input parameters, before voting or casting lots as modelled above.</p>
<p>The outcome of the decision procedure is recorded, along with which agents had their preferences realised by the procedure. This process of agent creation, decision, and measurement is repeated 1000 times to generate a probability density function with frequency based likelihoods that any agent will have their preference realised by a given procedure.</p>
<p>Substantive equality is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the likelihood that an agent's preferences will be realised by a decision process. The idea here is that a process is substantively equal (SD is low) whenever agents have equiprobable preference realisation. When it is likely that some agents rather than others will have their preferences realised (SD is high), then a process has little substantive equality.</p>
<p>The first parameter value examined is preference distribution. We start with a uniformly random distribution of preferences across agents ie. roughly equal numbers of each preference being held. We then <code>skew</code> the distribution of preferences so that more of one preference is common within our <em>digital demos</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expectation here is that when preferences are evenly distributed, all three procedures will realise substantive equality. When preferences are skewed, however, we will (hopefully) see voting but not sortition result in persistent minorities, and thus not realise substantive equality.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Now we have a criteria for saying when sortition is better than majority voting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, we look at preference distribution over time. Preferences on distinct issues can be consistent or independent. <code>Consistency</code> in preferences here means that if an agent has preference <code>A</code> on issue <code>1</code>, then they will likely have preference <code>A</code> for issue <code>2</code>. We repeat our simulation with both a range of <code>skew</code> and <code>consistency</code> values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expectation now is that when preferences are consistently skewed, persistent minorities will be present in all procedures. None of them will realise substantive equality in these circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we add influence to the model. By influence I mean informal political power (the ability to chance other's preferences) as opposed to formal power (the right to vote). We run the simulation again with influence values ranging from uniform to highly concentrated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The expectation here is that influence will undermine substantive equality in even the non-skewed voting processes. I'm really not sure what will happen for sortition.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also for debate here is whether we should treat the influence as resulting in enlightened preference or are others misled. The former requires measuring against final preference while the latter against initial preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will this be enough to seriously challenge egalitarian justifications of democracy? I have a strong hunch that it will undermine the application of these accounts to our actual democracies that use voting rather than sorting and have concentrated informal power structures.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>computational approaches have much to offer philosophy because they overcome the epistemic limitations associated with complexity, intractability, and emergence.</p></li>
<li><p>augmented argumentation offers additional benefits because it overcomes the key methodological challenges of simulation, namely reproducability and reliability.</p></li>
