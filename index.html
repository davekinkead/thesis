	  <blockquote>"The interplay of individual choices, where unorganised segregation is concerned, is a complex system with collective results that bear no close relation to individual intent."</br>
	  	-- Thomas Schelling
        </blockquote>

        <p>This is a reproduction of Thomas Schelling's seminal 1969 work using agent based modelling with coffeescript, D3.js, and HTML. </p> 
        <p> In it, a system is populated with red and blue agents. Neither agent type is racist - both simply have a slight preference (55%) for their neighbourhood to be populated with similar types of agents. All that is required for complete segreation is the application of two rules:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Agents are happy if their neighbourhood exceeds their composition preference.</li>
          <li>When they are unhappy, they move to a random new location.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>What the simulation demonstrates is that segregation (or any system level behaviour) is not necessarily the result of individual intent.</p>
