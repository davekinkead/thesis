# Epistemology of Simulation


## General Issues


  - the results of experiments in physics usually come to be accepted primarily on rational evidential grounds @franklin1986, @franklin1989, @franklin2002
  - ‘They provide us with good reasons for belief in experimental results’ (Franklin 2002, 6).

  - verification & validation

## Challenges for Simulation

**Reliability**

  - the implementation of a simulation can introduce errors @olsson2011

  - use the sherlock Holms approach to validation @parker2008

**Procedural Literacy**

  - @wheeler2013

**Validation**

**Verification**

**Validity** 
  - internal
  - external

Taxonomies of sources of error in simulation studies are presented in more detail in various places, including Oberkampf et al. (1995), Roache (1998), Winsberg (1999a), and Parker (2008)
