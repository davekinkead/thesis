# Bootstrapping Democracy

### "bootstrapping"

**present participle of boot·strap (Verb)**

1. Get (oneself or something) into or out of a situation using existing resources.
2. Start up (an enterprise), esp. one based on the Internet, with minimal resources.


### My Thesis

I'm defending the thesis that democracy, according to extant accounts at least, is not democratic.


### My Argument:

1. A system can be justified as democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.

2. A substantive number of systems & procedures of democracy cannot be justified as democratic by any coherent interpretation of the term.

3. Democracy therefore, cannot be justified as democratic.


### The Boundary Problem

The Boundary Problem is concerned with the normative justification of jurisdiction.  Who ought be part of the people, and therefore which group should rightfully govern themselves is a totally neglected aspect of democratic theory. [^1][^2]
