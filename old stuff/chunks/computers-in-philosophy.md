# Computers in Philosophy


## Key Fields

**Philosophy of Information**

The overarching subdiscipline 

- floridi: the philosophical field concerned with (a) the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilisation, and sciences, and (b) the elaboration and application of information- theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems. (p137)


**Digital Philosophy**

- Fredkin: Digital Philosophy (DP) replaces continuous variables as models for physical processes at the most fundamental (microscopic) level by automata theory.

Fredkin, E. (2003). An introduction to digital philosophy. International Journal of Theoretical Physics, 42(2), 189-247.

> SEP organizes the profession of philosophy to collaboratively maintain a dynamic open access  reference  work. 

> After developing a proof of concept from 1995–97,  SEP  staff  won  successive  grants  from NEH (1998–2000), NSF (2000–03), and NEH (2003–05) to build content and a “Web content management system” that could sup­port the operational workflow needed in a dynamic reference work. (p502)

Transforms the creation of traditional philosophy (invited, curated) and disemination (open access, web based) of traditional philosophy.



**The Philosophy of Information**

Floridi, L. (2002). What is the Philosophy of Information?. Metaphilosophy, 33(1‐2), 123-145.

Example terms for the field

> Some follow such fashionable terminology as cyberphilosophy, digital philosophy, and computational philosophy, most express specific theoretical orientations, such as philosophy of computer science, philosophy of computing or computation, philosophy of AI, computers and philosophy, computing and philosophy, philosophy of the artificial, and android epistemology. (p123)

>  The view defended in this essay is that PI is a mature discipline because (a) it represents an autonomous field (unique topics); (b) it provides an innovative approach to both traditional and new philosophical topics (orig- inal methodologies); and (c) it can stand beside other branches of philoso- phy, offering the systematic treatment of the conceptual foundations of the world of information and of the information society (new theories) (p124)

> AI acted as a Trojan horse, introducing a more encompassing computa- tional/informational paradigm into the philosophical citadel (p125)

PI deals with three types of domain:  (p126)
  - topics (facts, data, problems, phenomena, observations, and the like); 
  - methods (techniques, approaches, and so on); 
  - theories (hypotheses, explanations, and so forth)

> PI was perceived to be at too much of a crossroads of technical matters, theoretical issues, applied problems, and conceptual analyses to be anyone’s own area of specialisation. PI was considered to be transdisciplinary like cybernetics or semiotics, rather than interdiscipli- nary like biochemistry or cognitive science(p126)

> In 1985, the American Philosophical Association created the Committee on Philosophy and Computers (PAC) (p128)

Defining Philosophy of Information 

> philosophy of information (PI) =def. the philosophical field concerned with (a) the critical investigation of the conceptual nature and basic principles of information, including its dynamics, utilisation, and sciences, and (b) the elaboration and application of information- theoretic and computational methodologies to philosophical problems. (p137)

!! Simulation as argument sits squarely in the second part of this definition

> The second half of the definition indicates that PI is not only a new field but provides an innovative methodology as well. (p139)

Computational methods have been used to:

  -  to extend our understanding of the cognitive and linguistic abilities of humans and animals and the possibility of artificial forms of intelligence (philosophy of AI; information-theoretic semantics; information-theoretic epistemology; dynamic semantics);

  - to analyse inferential and computational processes (philosophy of computing; philosophy of computer science; information-flow logic; situation logic);

  - to explain the organizational principles of life and agency (philosophy of artificial life; cybernetics and philosophy of automata; decision and game theory);

  - to devise new approaches to modelling physical and conceptual systems (formal ontology; theory of information systems; philosophy of virtual reality);

  - to formulate the methodology of scientific knowledge (model-based philoso- phy of science; computational methodologies in philosophy of science);

  -  to investigate ethical problems (computer and information ethics; arti- ficial ethics), 

  - to investigate aesthetic issues (digital multimedia/hypermedia theory; hypertext theory and literary criticism), 

  - to investigate psychological, anthropological, and social phenomena characterising the information society and human behaviour in digital environments (cyberphilosophy).


> PI attempts to expand the frontier of philosophical research not by putting together pre- existing topics, and thus reordering the philosophical scenario, but by enclosing new areas of philosophical inquiry – which have been struggling to be recognised and have not yet found room in the traditional philosoph- ical syllabus – and by providing innovative methodologies to address traditional problems from new perspectives. (p140)

**Key assumptions**

> PI presupposes that a problem or an explanation can be legitimately and genuinely reduced to an informational problem or explanation. (p140)

Floridi sees PI as a continuation of the movement from Metaphysics to Epistemology to phil of language to logic (to Information)

> The scientific revolution made seventeenth-century philosophers redirect their attention from the nature of the knowable object to the epistemic relation between it and the knowing subject, and hence from metaphysics to epis- temology. (p141)
