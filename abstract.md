# Borders & Legitimacy

## What's the Problem with the Boundary Problem?

This is an argument about the relationship between democratic inclusion and instrumental justifications of democracy.  I show that any account of democracy that relies on the outcomes of democracy processes to demonstrate democracy's value must have a congruent account of inclusion.  Not only that, but because different accounts of democracy rely on different and incompatible accounts of inclusion, these accounts of democracy are themselves incompatible.

This paper is unique in that is simultaneously a philosophical argument and a computer simulation.  Written in [literate coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), the code descibed in the paper can also be run by the coffeescript compiler to demonstrate the argument being described by the paper.  The reader may generate both the argument in PDF, or the simulation and results in HTML with the command `coffee paper.coffee.md`.
