# Democracy has a problem

<!-- Beneath accounts of democratic theory lie a number of paradoxes and problems that undermine the project of democratic legitimacy. -->

---

<!-- Despite a revival of interest in the normative foundations of democracy from political theorists over the last 40 years, little progress has been made beyond Churchill's pragmatic quip that 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time'.  -->

> ### Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time.

Winston Churchill

Perhaps because democracy _can't_ be justified.

<!-- According to procedural accounts of democracy, legitimacy is derived from adherence or fidelity to some process or constitution.  But how can the creation of this constitution be legitimate when its creation proceeds it existence? -->

<!-- According to liberal theory, legitimacy requires the protection of certain individual rights and freedoms.  But how can disagreement over the limits between public and private be decided without undermining liberalism? Determining this limit collectively makes the question of what is a private right a public issue.  But determining the limit by some other means, say judicially, requires some earlier agreement on how the limit will be decided, and simply pushes the problem back one level.-->

# The Bootstrap Paradox

<!-- These problems are examples of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox.  The inability of democracy to justify itself on democratic grounds. -->

---

<!-- The thesis I'm going to defend in my dissertation is that democracy, according to extant accounts at least, democracy is not democratic. -->

# Democracy is not Democratic

<!-- Its establishment, alteration and operation all require justificatory recourse to non-democratic ideals, and any substantively non-democratic system cannot be justified as being democratic.  -->

---

## The Argument:

---

<!-- My core argument can be stated as follows: -->

P1 - A system can be justified as democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.

---

P2 - A substantive number of systems & procedures of democracy cannot be justified as democratic by any coherent interpretation of the term.

---

C1 - Democracy therefore, cannot be justified as democratic.

<!-- Each claim of this argument roughly maps to a third of my thesis.  What do we mean by democracy? Is it a system or a set of ideals, a government or a theory?  Like many paradoxes, it is possible that the Bootstrap Paradox is little more than invalid deduction camouflaged by semantic equivocation.  So considerable effort will need to be spent clarifying exactly what _democracy_ means according to various accounts of it.  This is the focus of part one. -->

<!-- Part two will focus on the problems that make up the bootstrap paradox. The paradox of constitution, the limits of liberalism, voting on voting and the boundary problem; and examine how they undermine democratic accounts of legitimacy. -->

<!-- Part three will, I hope at least, identify viable avenues for potential solutions and just maybe, a solution.  Right now, that's a long way off.  What follows is a brief overview of parts one and two. -->

---

# What democracy?

<!-- Democracy has become a largely vacuous notion.  Today, people use the term to describe any vaguely warm feelings towards some system of government they may have. -->

<!-- Recent media coverage is illustrative. -->

> ### Compulsory voting is an infringement of the democratic rights of Australians.

Liberal Senator Nick Minchin, 29 Sep 2012

---

> ### Compulsory voting is a pillar of democracy. 

Liberal MP Josh Frydenberg, 4 Jan 2013

---

When a term means everything, it means nothing.

---

<!-- I'm not going to offer much in the way of clarification about what I think democracy is today.  As Dahl notes, these questions lead us into a "tedious exploration of a semantic bog".  -->

> ### A tedious exploration of a semantic bog

Ronald Dahl, _Polyarchy_, p1

<!-- I'm still not convinced there is a single definitive notion of 'democracy'.

But what is important to draw from this is that our interpretations both guide and constrain possible accounts of democratic legitimacy and affect the way we can respond to the bootstrap paradox. -->

---

# Ideals

<!-- If it's an ideal, then which one? -->

---

# Popular Sovereignty 

<!-- Etymology suggests popular sovereignty or the demos' rule but does this mean rule of, by or for the people? -->

---

### For _the people_
### By _the people_
### Of _the people_

---

# Participation

<!-- Rule _by_ the people suggestions participation so does that favour direct or deliberative accounts over representation? Something very few current 'democracies' have. -->

---

# Voting

<!-- Modern democracies are characterised by free and fair elections. Voting is often synonymous with democracy but what type? -->

---

### Majoritarianism, Super Majorities or Consensus?

<!-- Is majoritarianism, super majorities or consensus necessary? -->

---

### Sortition or Lot

<!-- Do we need voting at all? Athenians employed very little voting in their democracies - most decisions were made by committees selected by sortition or lot. -->

---

# Equality

<!-- What's the role of political equality in democracy. It seems important but only about 10% of Athenians were enfranchised and today, presidents are regularly elected by less than a quarter of the people  -->

---

## Liberalism and Freedom

<!-- Liberalism also seems pretty central to our conception of democracy but this also seems to conflict with popular sovereignty -->

---

### Solidarity
### Community
### Deliberation 
### Consent

---

# Systems

### Preference Aggregation

<!-- social choice theorists - collective aggregation of individual preferences -->

---

### Competing Interest Groups
### Polyarchy

<!-- Madison saw value in separating powers and making them compete -->

# Accounts

<!-- These conceptions of democracy shape and constrain how we justify it -->

<!-- Accounts & justifications of democratic legitimacy can be roughly allocated along three axis.  -->

---

# Foundationalist
&
# Anti-Foundationalist

<!-- Criterion of _where_ the source of legitimacy lies -->

---

# Instrumental
&
# Intrinsic

<!-- Criterion of _what_ legitimacy is derived from. -->

---

# Procedural
&
# Substantive

<!-- Criterion of _how_ legitimacy is derived. -->

<!-- All six approaches face their own set challenges. Foundationalist and intrinsic accounts must first explain why their foundational premises are self evident before showing why democracy is entailed from those premises. 

Anti-foundational fail to allow comparative analysis as their legitimation can only occurs after deliberation. 

Instrumental accounts have the reverse of the foundationalist challenge - they must show democracy is the best means to realise certain ends, as well as why those ends should be valued. 

Procedural accounts must ensure they don’t clash with any substantive democratic values whilst substantive accounts still require procedures to realise their core values. -->

---

# Lexical Priority

<!-- Are the actions of a democracy _democratic_, or is it _acting_ democratic make a state a democracy?  The former is certainly the easy solution as it solves the problem _ex vi termini_, but it doesn't give use any philosophical insight or make comparative claims possible. -->

---

> ### If a country has the term 'democratic' in its name, then it usually isn't

Dave, today.

---

## Utopian Visions

<!-- A related issue is that of potentiality and realisation. Idealised or utopian accounts of democracy posit that democratic legitimacy is also derived from the fidelity of actual democracies to their ideals. They require us to not only determine what a perfect democracy would be, but how close our current states approximate perfect ones. Non-ideal theories on the other hand, argue that the democratic nature of a state can only be assessed according to what is likely to be achievable. -->

---

...a segway...

<!-- What do I need to show for premise 1 -->
---

# Boundary Problem

<!-- Im only going to focus on one problem today, in order to provide sufficient illumination of how these foundational problems seep up and infect democratic theory.  And that problem is the boundary problem. -->

--- 

### The story of democracy begins with a people...

<!-- They come together, unite, proclaim, declare and form as one: -->

---

>  We the People  of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

---

>  Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under ... the Constitution hereby established.

---

> Le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés.

---

Democratic theory is built upon an assumption that a people, _the people_, exist and exist rightfully so.  

<!-- Yet who the people _ought_ be, and therefore which group should rightfully govern themselves, is a totally neglected and absolutely crucial problem for which there seems no theoretical solution to. -->

---

# Democracy wants to be legitimate.  

<!-- A principle object of the democratic project is to show why we have moral obligations to obey a properly constituted democratic government. -->

---

### Legitimacy requires difference making

<!-- But in order to claim legitimacy, democratic theory needs to show it makes a difference.  A legitimate democratic process must bring about a different state of affairs or realise a different set of values than an illegitimate one would not. Otherwise, how could the two be distinguished? -->

---

# Who determines what

<!-- The problem in the Boundary problem arises once we realise that 'the who' determines 'the what'. -->

---

## An Example:

<!-- Imaging a state with multiple national groups like the former Yugoslavia or Soviet Union, Ireland, Canada, Belgium or Rwanda and one of the minority nationalities wants independence.  Assume all participants are committed democrats, and hold democratic identical values, but opposing views on whether succession is a good thing.  Now the outcome of any democratic process to answer the succession question is determined by _who_ is included in the process.  If only the succeeding people are involved, then the answer with be very different to if only the successor people are, and different again if all parties are.-->

---

<!-- This is not just an issue of independence or unification however.-->

The boundary problem infects every process of collective decision making when divergent views exist. 

<!--Examples:-->

<!-- Should we redistribute half the wealth of the wealthiest 1% to the poorest 50% of society?  If we ask the _haves_, then the answer will surely be different to if we ask the _have nots_. -->

<!-- Should we include christian scripture in public schools? Again, the answer will depend on who we ask, regardless of the decision making process used.-->

---

### This is not a problem that democratic theory can solve.

<!--
If we take legitimacy to be derived from fidelity to some democratic procedure, then it is immediately clear that a democratically legitimate solution results in an infinite regress.  If we are to vote, justify or deliberate on the issue of who should be included amongst the people, then we must first vote, justify or deliberate on the prior issue of who decides who decides who is included.  But to do this, we must first decide who decides who decides, and so on.  

If on the other hand, we take legitimacy to be derived from some substantive notion or ideal, then we are still faced with the problem.  Extant substantive justifications  that support democracy fail to provide a plausible solution to the boundary problem.  And substantive ideals such as consensus that might solve the problem fail to provide sufficient justification for democratic legitimacy. -->

---

# Non-Democratic Solutions.

<!-- Frederick Whelan provides a good coverage of these options:-->

---

## Status Quo?

<!-- The first of course is the status quo.  Why not accept the boundaries of yesterday today? But this simply holds democratic legitimacy hostage to the accidents of history.  That Australia is a constitutional monarchy today, owes just as much to the fact that in 1766 Admiral de Bougainville turned north rather than south when he was stopped by the Great Barrier Reef as it does to the procedures of the 1999 referendum.-->

---

# Nationality?

<!-- Nationality seems to define status but this is unsuitable because simply because no agreed objective criterion of nationality exists.  Add to this the fact that talk of 'Yugoslavian', 'Soviet',or even 'Australian' people shows that boundaries define nationalities as often as nationalities define boundaries. -->

---

# Salience?

<!-- Economic, cultural or geographic salience are similarly problematic. Mountains only look like boarders to people from the plains. Rivers divide as much as focus economic activity. And one only needs to look at satellite imagery to see human settlement is defined by political boundaries rather than the other way around.-->

---

<!-- But two notions do hold promise. Consent and Affect.-->

# Constent

<!-- Consent has long underpinned democratic accounts of legitimacy. Why not define a people by all those who choose to identify amongst them?  While this seems to work for voluntary associations like clubs and churches, the failure of consent to legitimate the non-voluntary and exclusive territorial claims of state sovereignty are well know.-->

---

# All-Affected-Principle

<!-- So we are left with what is know as the All-Affected-Principle which asserts that we ought include all those affected by some decision. This also has prima faces plausibility but again quickly fails. -->

<!-- Who is affected by a decision depends on the outcome of the decision.  But the outcome can only be known after the decision has been made.  Accepting all those _actually_ affected entails the absurd situation of giving no one a say if a decision is defeated and the status quo remains.  Enfranchising those _actually_ affected gets things backwards so we must rather enfranchise all those _possibly_ affected. -->

<!-- But who is _possibly_ affected could be very large indeed. Do I need to be physically, economically or emotionally affected to be included?  Should I have a say in how Saudi's treat women because it offends me?  US policy can affect Australia so should we have a say in US elections? -->

<!-- So while something like Mill's Harm Principle or Burnheim's notion of a legitimate material interest could likely offer us a way out of this problem, we are left with two more. -->

<!-- Who is affected depends on the issue to be decided which seems to entail some notion of overlapping issue based jurisdictions if democracy is to be realised.  And while I don't think this is problematic for democratic theory, it is clearly incompatible with the territorial exclusivity of state sovereignty. -->

<!-- A bigger problem with the all-affected-principle arises once we understand that who is affected by a decision is in turn determined by who can propose an issue and this creates a whole new boundary problem of its own. -->

---

### Example: 

<!-- Should Gina Rineheart donate half her wealth to alleviating climate change? Clearly, the answer depends on who is asked. But who should this even be a matter for the democratic process and who should determine if it is or not? -->

---

### Global Jurisdictions? 

<!-- The only way out is to enfranchise everyone and create some kind of global jurisdiction.  A great idea, and one endorsed by a number of theorists, until one realises it is incompatible with other democratic notions like autonomy and self rule. -->

---

Enfranchising those not affected, undermines my autonomy as much as disenfranchising me.
 
<!-- My autonomy in a collective process is a function of my influence. Assuming political equality and 100 people affected equally, then my 1/100 say in the matter maximises my autonomy.  Disenfranchise me and I lose 1/100 of control.  But grant 100 a say in a matter that only affects me and my autonomy is diminished to 1/100 of what it should be and I lose far more autonomy by enfranchising unaffected others than by disenfranchisement.-->

---
# All-and-Only-Affected-Principle

<!-- The only solution then, is an all-and-only-affected-principle.  But this obviously pushes us back to the problem of overlapping issue based jurisdictions.-->

---

The Boundary Problem is just one of many problems that lie at the foundations of democratic theory.

<!--   Problems that cannot be solved democratically, and undermine the legitimacy of subsequent theory. -->

---

<!-- Because of this..... -->

### Many of the systems and processes of democracy can't be justified as democratic.

---

When a substantive number of processes aren't democratic, then a government or theory cannot be justified as democratic.

---

# Democracy is not democratic.

---

<!-- Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy cannot recover from founding paradoxes without turning into utopian or substantive accounts.-->

<!-- And substantive accounts seem unable to both underpin democratic legitimacy and solve the boundary problem.-->

# Bootstrapping Democracy

<!-- But, if we could develop an account where adherence to the process is also the realisation of the substantive ideal, then we have a potential way to bootstrap our way out of these dilemmas.  We would be able to bootstrap democracy.-->
