# Simulation as argument

How has simulation been used in philosophy?

Let's focus on knowledge generating endevours that seeks to understand the universe in an objective sense.... 

With empiric knowledge, we observe the external world, design an experiment, generate observational data, and make an amplative inference to some new belief (or non-amplative inference to reject a proposed belief)

  - empiric science (newton)
  - theoretical science (einstein)

With a priori argument, we assert some claim about the world, and show how that entails some other belief

  - aristotle showed how future contingents are ...
  - foot showed how our intuitions on abortion clash with reason

With simulation, we observe the world or theory, design a model, generate observational data, and make a non-amplative inference to some new belief.

  - axelrod 'discovers' tit-for-tat dominates iterative spacialised prisoner's dilemmas.
  - zalta disovers a new ontological argument for god.
