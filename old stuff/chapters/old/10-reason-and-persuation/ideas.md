Beauty & Pursuation

>  Indeed, if the reader were to analyze which clauses of each premise are used in the prover9 proof, then it would become clear exactly what part of the content of each of the logical and non-logical premises is actually used in the argument.  ... In any case, the computationally-simplified version of the argument reveals that it has a subtle logical beauty. (p17)

Compuational approach leads to a new insight

> Fifth, the new analysis of the argument brings out much more clearly that it deploys diagonal reasoning for a positive conclusion. By contrast, most diagonal arguments in the history of philosophy have been deployed to develop paradoxes (p18)
