## Introduction

This is an argument about authority.  More specifically though, it's an argument about democratic authority and how what we typically think are justifications of democratic authority, are in actual fact rationalisations of it.  That's because accounts of democratic authority, all of them, fail to adequately justify the authority of the state.  What we are left with is a collection of sporadically connected reasons to obey - attempts to make the coercive power of the state more palatable to those it coerces.  Reasons that are sometime persuasive, but never coherent.

I'm going to defend the thesis that if political authority requires justification, then democracy cannot justify political authority.  And I'm going to do this by showing how paradoxes that lie at the foundations of democratic theory - paradoxes relating to the who, what, and how of democratic activity - undermine even the most charitable accounts of political justification.  My conclusion will be that democratic states, at least as we know them today, can never justify their claims to authority, but can only rationalise them.  

This is not to say that democracy lacks any value however.  There are a number of very good reasons for valuing democracy, or preferring it to alternative regimes.  Neither is it to say that future democratic states will be unable to coherently justify political authority.  Democracy as a system of government has been in a continual state of evolution and change for the last 2500 years.  But while democratic states claim sovereignty over the people to the extent they current do, then democratic theory cannot give coherent reasons for the people to obey them.


## Authority & Justification

What's the difference between the state and a criminal organisation?  There are some obvious ones of course: size, ethnic heritage, access to resources etc.  But let's ignore these for a moment and focus on more relevant descriptive and normative criteria.  Both groups exercise power over particular geographical areas.  Both groups offer non-voluntary policing and protection services.  Both groups extract rents in return for those services.  And both groups use violence against those they ostensibly claim to serve in order to further their aims.

The key difference between the state and the mafia then, is normative.  While both claim power and want obedience, and while we have strong prudential reasons for obeying them, only in the case of the state do we have independent extra-prudential reasons for compliance.  We have moral reasons to support and obey the state that we do not have towards the mafia.  In fact, we might even have moral reasons to actively resist or thwart criminal gangs.  This is what we mean by political authority.

Political authority is what gives us reasons to obey the state but not just any reason will do.  We can have moral duties towards other citizens or governments for a variety of reasons but only some of these reasons stem from political authority.  Some of these other reasons are universal moral duties to all people.  Other reasons might be purely prudential - the difference between _de jure_ and _de facto_ authority.  These reasons might be internally or externally imposed.

It is only a special type of moral reason for action that constitutes _legitimate_ political authority.  This can be interpreted as the right to rule, the obligation to obey, or simply a justification for coercive action.  But authority as the right to rule captures too little of the concept.  Ruling in this sense becomes vacuous if there is no corresponding obligation to obey.  Authority as a justification for action however captures too much.  There might be many situations when a state's actions against a people are justified but they lack authority over those people.  Unilateral responses to externalities like climate change, or encroachment into a neutral party's territory during war are some examples of this.  Only when people have obligations to obey, may we say that those with the corresponding right to rule have authority.

Following from @green our working definition of legitimate or _de jure_ authority might be something like this.

> Someone or something has authority when their giving of content independent & pre-emptive reasons for action is sufficient to generate obligations of obedience.  When a subject has sufficient reasons to take action just because someone one believes to have authority said so.

So any account of political authority must show that (following @green and @simmons):

  - it gives subjects moral reasons for obeying
  - those reasons are content independent
  - those reasons are binding on subject
  - that all subjects must obey all laws.
  - that subjects are bound to particular states

So how can political authority be justified?  Or stated another way, under what conditions is authority _legitimate_? A first step is to distinguish between justifications that generate permissibility, obligation, and the ideal.  Another step is to examine types of moral obligations - associate, transactional, and natural duty obligation. 

Next, we must examine what it means to justify something.  While my claim is that we must believe the state has authority, does any belief count?  Here I segway to another critique of Webber and show why unfounded beliefs, contradictory or incoherent beliefs, or state brainwashing are insufficient for justifying authority.
  
We must believe the state has political authority for the right reasons. We need to know that our beliefs are warranted.  A number of accounts of when our beliefs are warranted _warrant_ are available.  @rawls offers public justification. A belief is warranted when it is supported by reasons that reasonable people would reasonably accept. This account is too strong however - it requires too much.  It fails to adequately address a criteria for reasonableness which has lead to significant debate (see @quong & @gaus).  In contrast, @rorty offers us anti-foundationalism. But this account is too weak.  It doesn't place sufficient demands on the quality of belief or its transmission.

Instead, I propose we adopt a minimalist account of the epistemic requirements of political justification - warranted transmission:

>  A subject s's justification for belief p based on evidence e transmits to p's logical consequence belief q iff:  
>
>    i)   s has justification for believing p based on e,  
>    ii)  s knows that q is deducible from p, and  
>    iii) s has justification for believing q in virtue of the satisfaction of (i) and (ii).

Logical consequence is the key here.  It eliminates incoherent or contradictory beliefs while being truth agnostic.  It means that validity in prior to posterior belief is a necessary condition for political authority.  And the consequence of this is that any account of political authority which is invalid cannot warrant the belief that that authority is legitimate.

We now have a framework for analysing democratic authority in the rest of this thesis.  Democratic authority may be rationalised - by offering reasons to make it tolerable _post hoc_.  Democratic authority may be vindicated - by showing that certain desirable states of affairs are a probable consequent of it (see @cohen1971). Or democratic authority may be justified - shown to be legitimate by offering reasons that are warranted.

In much the same way one might refute an argument's soundness, the account of epistemic warrant discussed above offers two vectors for criticism.  Firstly, it may be possible to show that an account of democracy fails to entail, that it's _q_ is not deducible from its _p's_.  To do this, it is necessary to demonstrate some internal contradiction within the account of democracy that makes it's conclusion about _de jure_ authority impossible - that democracy cannot justify authority in some hypothetical world.

Secondly, it may be possible to show that there is insufficient evidence to justify belief in the conditions of the account in the first place.  This would require demonstrating that we have insufficient evidential grounds for accepting an account's _p's_ in the actual world.  In the second half of this thesis, I will show that no account of democracy adequately justifies political authority.


## Defining Democracy

Democracy has meant many things to many people. It can mean a theory, an ideal, a system of government, or a set of social practices.  It also can be applied to many contexts.  States, organisations, families, humanity, even non-human groups.  Finally, the analysis of democracy and of democratic theories can be a descriptive or normative endeavour.  While many accounts of democracy are descriptive, these often have normative elements.  My focus in this thesis is exclusively on normative democratic theories and how they attempt to justify the political authority of the state.

Of normative account of democracy, some simply assume democracy to be required and attempt to show what form is best.  Others attempt to justify democracy _ab initio_.  Contemporary accounts tend to fall into the former group, while classical accounts fall into the latter.

I am yet to finalise how this chapter will be structured but I need to address the following themes from the literature:

  - instrumental vs intrinsic
  - transformative vs aggregative
  - necessary vs sufficient justifications
  - liberal
  - egalitarian
  - deliberative
  - radical

Almost all accounts of democracy can captured in the following logical form:

Instrumentally Sufficient

  1. Democracy brings about good things
  2. Good things are sufficient to warrant authority
  3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

Intrinsically sufficient

  1. Democracy is good
  2. Good is sufficient to warrant authority
  3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

Pragmatically necessary

  1. Authority is necessary
  2. Democracy is best/least worst form of authority
  3. Therefore democratic authority is warranted

Each of the following chapters will demonstrate why at least one of these justifications forms fails by showing that the account is impossible, or that there is insufficient evidence accept the premises of the justificatory account.


## Confusion over Consent

Consent is the most obvious way we can place obligations on ourselves.  The duty to obey a particular political authority can be considered a special obligation because it is owed to particular individuals or groups.  We can contrast this with general obligations, such as a consequentialist duty to maximise the good or a deontological duty not to murder, that are owed to all people or agents.  The obligation to obey is an agent-specific duty, rather than an agent neutral one, as it applies to particular citizens and is owed to particular states.

Of course there is some doubt that special obligations can exist at all.  Agent-specific duties are a particular challenge for any consequentialist moral theory.  In this case, if special obligations existed, because say, their existence maximised the good in some way, then they could only be derivative obligations to the natural duty to maximise good.  A utilitarian then could have an obligation to keep promises she made but this obligation would be derived wholly from the maximisation of utility.

Natural duties exist to all, regardless of actions performed.  Special obligations, by contrast, require some action or event to generate them.  The obligation to keep one's word is created the moment when one expresses a promise to do so.  The obligation to honour a contract is created when it is signed.  But these actions in isolation - the speaking of words or signing of names - are not sufficient.  A range of other conditions such as informedness and sincerity are also required.  

For political obligations, consent represents the intersection of these conditions and actions.  Citizens must know what they are consenting to, and they must be able to grant consent.  Some deny the possibility of consent. @wolff claims the natural duty of autonomy is incompatible with any notion of obedience.  @locke claims that autonomy if incompatible only with certain types of obedience like slavery.  But if an obligation to obey an authority can exist, then consent is sufficient to impose them.

Accounts of democracy have a long history of using consent to justify political authority. But these accounts have not been without problems.

  - historical review of consent: Crito, Hobbes, Locke, Hume, Kant.
  - voting vs tacit vs hypothetical

Voting is one very obvious candidate for a signal of consent. It is visible, explicit, and provides sufficient opportunity for informedness.  But consent changes moral relationships between parties. Typically from permission to obligation or from prohibition to permission.  Voting doesn't change the relationship between voters and the state.  The state demands obedience regardless of who one votes, or regardless even if one votes at all.  Voting doesn't change any moral relationship between citizen and government in the way consent requires, therefore voting cannot be consent.

Birth or naturalisation might change moral relationships however, so these could be valid instances of consent. Consent though, requires the possibility of non-consent to be meaningful.  Unless the costs of non-consent are independently justified, then any claim to consent will be coercive and thus invalidated.  But states claim authority without the consent of all members.  To impose the costs of non-consent requires an independent justification of authority.  If the state has this independent justification, then consent as a means to justify political authority becomes redundant.  And if however consent is necessary to justify the states authority to impose the costs of non-consent, then the argument is circular.

Locke's account of tacit consent is infamous for its inability to justify obligation to the state.  Mere residence is a poor signal of acceptance given the limited other choices many citizens have.  It unclear that residence is sufficient to generate obligation to the state as opposed to simple non-interference that one might have towards other states.  And as Hume showed with his press ganging ship's captain, the costs of non-consent are such that any consent should be considered as under duress.

One interesting consideration here can be derived from @frankfurt's challenge to free will.  Imagine some mischievous scientist places a neural control device in your brain that only activates when a particular choice is about to be made.  Whenever you go to choose chocolate, the device makes you choose vanilla, but when you choice vanilla, it doesn't activate.  In this scenario the counter-factual conception of freewill is not satisfied - you are not able to choose otherwise, even though you have freewill.  Our relationship with the state is similar. Even if you freely did chose to be bound to the state and wish for your vote to signal this intent, the state cannot claim or show that you have consented because you don't have the ability not to consent.

Some have claimed that consent like obligation can be generated even if one does not consent.  @estlund2005 argues that _hypothetical_ consent is possible.  In the same way that consent can be nulled if it fails to meet certain standards, non-consent can be nulled too.  If one _ought_ have consented to some endeavour but didn't, this non-consent can be nulled and obligations created just as duress nulls obligation from consent.

Bollocks! Hypothetical consent cannot create obligations.  An essential element of consent is its voluntary nature.  Counter-factual claims - you ought have consented - do not have this voluntary element so they cannot be consent.  The normative work must come from somewhere or something else, so hypothetical consent theories are really natural duty or associative obligation theories.

So because the sovereign claims of the state do not permit non-consent, consent to political authority cannot be given (so long as the state is non-voluntary).  And because consent cannot be given to a democratic state, consent cannot warrant democratic authority.


## The Paradox of the People

Many accounts of democracy justify political authority by reference to the outcomes of democratic processes.  Democracy brings about good things.  These outcomes might be judged according to some content independent criteria - that say, democracy tracks the truth.  They might be judged according to some content relative criteria - that democracy maximises individual preferences. Or they might be judged according to some content-indifferent criteria - that democracy improves the moral character of its citizens.

The outcomes of these processes however, are a function of who is included in those processes.  Including different people amongst _the people_ can change the outcome of the democratic process.  Sometimes, in the case of knife edge decisions, including or excluding a single voter will result in a different outcome.  Other times, millions of voters would need to be substituted for the result to be different.  How and when different accounts of inclusion affect the outcomes of democratic processes depends on the composition of voters and their distribution across a political space.

Any political association can be constituted differently to how it currently is.  The world is divided into 196 recognised sovereign states but these divisions are arbitrary - the results of the accidents of history.  There is no reason that the world couldn't be divided into 1000 states, 100, 10, or even one (the range could be anywhere between 1 and 7 billion assuming a single person state).  For each set of states, their borders could be draw almost anywhere, even with constraints of contiguity and proportionality imposed (constraints that aren't present in our current political divisions).  And for each potential state, the same potential partitions apply internally as nations are divided into states, and states into local government areas.  Given the multitude of possible political associations, and the fact that different associations will produce different democratic outcomes, some account of democratic inclusion is required for these instrumental accounts.

Different accounts of inclusion will support or undermine different accounts of democracy depending on the composition and distribution of voters.  Different borders will produce different results, and different accounts of democracy require different accounts of inclusion.  Content independent justifications of democracy like Condorcet's or Estlund's for example, require a composition of citizens sufficiently diverse and competent for collective judgement aggregation to outperform some form of epistocracy or even random selection.  Without this diversity within polities, democracy has no epistemic value.

Content-relative justifications of democracy like preference realisation accounts by contrast, require citizens to be sufficiently homogeneous for democratic preference aggregation to have value.  They only work when most voters have similar values (or can at least always work better given some other account of inclusion).  These accounts of democracy require incompatible accounts of inclusion, and given the same demos, the requirements of of only one account of democracy can be met. As such, any account of democracy that is based on the instrumental value of democratic outputs must also offer a corresponding, and congruent, account of inclusion.  Failure to do so will mean that any claim of democratic authority's legitimacy is not warranted.

The dilemma for democracy is that while these instrumental accounts of democracy require the articulation of a supporting account of inclusion, democratic theory cannot offer any answers to the question of inclusion.  That's because any attempt to answer the question of inclusion - who the people ought be - democratically, results in an infinite regress.  Before we can vote on who gets to vote, we must first vote on who gets to vote for who gets to vote.

Neither can non-democratic accounts of inclusion help.  Many of these lack the sufficient normative to justify inclusion of one group over another.  Accounts of inclusion based on nationality, historic accident, linguistic, economic, or cultural salience are like this.  But accounts of inclusion that are sufficiently normative either lack sufficient specificity or enfranchise too many. The all-coerced principle merely says that anyone subject to a law must be included in the law making processes.  This however only says what is necessary for _any_ political association.  

The all-affected principle says that anyone affected by some law should have a say in the matter.  This results in either a single global demos or issue specific demoi.  A global demos is compatible with content-independent instrumental justifications but content-relative ones.  Overlapping demoi are compatible with content-relative instrumental justifications but not content-independent ones.  And neither are compatible with the current Westphalian system of states.  

Thus, no existing democratic state is justifiable on instrumental grounds, and it is doubtful that any democratic state could be.  Not only is it the case that the actual conditions necessary for instrumental accounts to be entailed are not realised, but the inability to identify the most appropriate account of inclusion means instrumental justifications of democratic authority are not internally coherent.


## The Limits of Limits

Democracy requires limits.  A line in the sand to demarcate what belongs in the realm of the public and what belongs to the private. Limits to the scope of its power are essential for a functioning democracy.

Without constraints to the scope of democratic authority, naked majoritarianism can quickly descend into tyranny.  As theorists from Aristotle to Acton have observed - power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  History is littered with the debris of states whose popularly elected leaders became despots once elected and whose power was not checked.

But the concern here is not only for curtailing the power of potential tyrants in a representative democracy but also to prevent the tyranny of the majority in direct decisions.  Montesquieu, Tocqueville, Maddison, & Hamilton were all acutely aware of how persistent minorities and abuse by alliances or majorities can undermine democratic values and functions.

Now some of these limits are essential to the functioning of healthy democracy.  A free press, a secret ballot, and freedom to express opinion and associate are all essential ingredients for public discourse and free and fair elections.  Without these, democracy becomes a hollow empty shell - democracy in name only.  These limits are purely functional.

But some of these limits are necessary for democracy to have value.  Liberalism and democracy are distinct political concepts.  Illiberal democracy and liberal non-democracy, while not nearly as common as liberal democracy, are perfectly valid conjunctions.  And while distinct, the complementary nature of the democracy and liberalism is a critical part of why so many desire democratic rule over other forms of government.  These limits are substantive.

One way to demonstrate this is by a thought experiment of totalitarian democracy.  Imaging a society of total popular sovereignty and perfect political equality where every facet of life is decided by direct decision.  What to where, what to eat, where to holiday, are all decisions that are made by majority vote.  This dystopian democracy satisfies all the requirements of democracy but seems to be something that few would value.

And some of these limits are specific to particular conceptions and justifications of democracy.  Democratic authority justified on the grounds of liberty requires limits that protect individual freedoms.  Democratic authority justified on the grounds of equality requires limits that ensure political equality - one vote one value, constraints on money in politics etc.

Limits then, are essential to democracy.  And these limits are specific to particular conceptions of democracy.  So how can we determine what these limits ought be?  One way we can’t determine them is democratically.  That’s because any democratic action is a collective action.  The limits to democracy are limits to what can be determined democratically.  So using a collective action to determine what is immune from collective action is self-effacing. The very act of doing so places the scope of what is private and protected into the scope of the public.

So what about extra-democratic limits?  Constitutional liberalism is typically offered as a solution to this dilemma. By specifying a set of rights that cannot be infringed by the majority, and formalising those constraints in a constitution, personal freedom is promoted and tyranny is held at bay.  While plausible, constitutional liberalism as a solution is undermined by the conditions of liberalism itself.

Liberalism requires a priority of rights.  It requires that certain ideals and behaviours are valued over others.   But some rights are incompatible with others. My right to privacy is incompatible with your right to know what I am doing.  Your right to bear arms is incompatible with my right to be protected from mass shootings.  And while it is certainly true that some rights, or sets of rights, are more compatible that others, the notion of rights and their correlative duties means that my right to ø will always be incompatible with your right to stop me ø-ing.

We now have the problem of determining this priority of rights.  And one way of doing this would be to point to some objective set of optimal liberties.  But of course, no objective account of optimal liberty exists.  Even if it did exist, it is quite possible that there would be a set of equally optimal but incompatible priorities of rights.  It seems highly problematic to determine the priority of incommensurable but competing value of say liberty and equality.

Compounding this problem is Rawls’ observation that the conditions of liberalism produce a plurality of conceptions of the good. In liberal societies, there will always be reasonable disagreement about the priority of rights.  Rawls’ solution is for liberal societies to determine this priority democratically but as we have already seen, this approach is incoherent.

Other substantive constraints to democracy’s scope face similar problems.  Democracy as justice can't be justified when the majority can override specific rights.  So it must first reach agreement on which form of justice is to be prioritised - procedural, substantive, historical, or future. Democracy as equality can't be justified when the majority can override procedural and substantive equality.  So it must first reach agreement on which form of equality is prioritised - of means, of opportunity

But what of constitutional constraints?  All modern democracies have formal legal constraints  that limit the powers of the executive, legislative, and judiciary.  And typically, these limits can be altered democratically via referenda. Don’t these limits work and aren’t they democratic?

To a degree, yes.  It’s certainly true that constitutional constraints promote a functional democracy.  And it’s true that they tend to limit abuses of power.  In this regard, any constitutional constraint is much better than no constraints at all - acting as a kind of hand-break on tyranny.  But the inability of democratic theory to explain and justify why the particular constraints in particular constitutions should be there rather than equally justifiable alternatives makes them some what arbitrary.  The content of these constraints must be specific and relevant to the particular conception of democratic value these constraints are supposed to promote and enable.  And without a coherent way of specifying them so that they are congruent with a particular vision of democracy, then they are largely arbitrary.

So if democratic authority requires coherent justifications, then our inability to justify the particular limits essential to democracy means that democratic authority can’t be justified.


## Paradoxes of Procedure

Democracies make decisions. It's why they exist.  All accounts of democracy, instrumental or intrinsic, transformative or aggregative, procedural or substantive, require specific procedures in order to make decisions that are collectively binding.

Different democratic procedures may produce different outcomes.  Plurality voting for example, penalises minor parties in representative electoral systems.  Proportional voting by contrast doesn't.  A vote tallied using the Condorcet methods can produce a different result to one using a Borda count, and to one using approval voting.  Given the same group of voters and question to be decided, deterministic procedures like preferential voting will result in the same output every time.  Indeterminate procedures like sortition however, will not.

_How_ people decide affects _what_ people decide.

Sometimes, democracy is justified by the claim that it is the best system for realising individual preferences in a collective setting.  But preferences are transitive.  If you prefer chocolate to vanilla, and vanilla to pistachio, then assuming you are rational, you should also prefer chocolate to pistachio.

Democracy must also be fair.  Fairness is essential to any democratic procedure.  The notion of political equality that is so central to the democratic ideal means that democracy is the antithesis of dictatorship.  In a democracy, everyone is entitled to an equal say, and no one gets to decide how others should vote.

Yet preference transitivity and fairness turnout to be incompatible when applied to decision procedures.  As @arrow1963 demonstrates with his Impossibility Thesis, no voting system can be designed that always satisfies the requirements of fairness, transitivity, and rational aggregation.  It is impossible for any non-cardinal aggregation procedure to simultaneously be non-dictatorial, collectively rational (if every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y), universal, and Pareto optimal.  There appears to be no coherent way to aggregate collective preferences.

Other times, democracy is justified on epistemic grounds.  Democracy, it is said, has a tendency to track the truth, and that is why we should accept democratic decisions as binding.  To believe something to be true however, one must have warrant to believe so.  Any non-tautological belief requires the satisfaction of an entailment and evidentiary criteria.  To be justified in believing some belief _q_, one must first be justified in believing _p_ entails or supports _q_, and that there is sufficient evidence to believe _p_ in the first place.





This chapter still requires a fair bit of work.  The basic argument is this:

  1. Procedures are necessary for democracy to function
  2. No procedure is congruent with democratic values
  3. Therefore democracy can never warrant authority

The first part of the chapter will examine paradoxes of preference aggregation such as Arrow's Impossibility theorem, and of judgement aggregation such as the doctrinal paradox.  These undermine instrumental justifications of democracy.  Many of the most common democratic procedures are incoherent in that they can't satisfy democratic ideals.

The second part examines how procedural paradoxes affect intrinsic justifications of democracy.  Substantive ideals such as fairness and equality have competing and incompatible conceptions.  Should we prioritise procedural fairness over distributive fairness or historical fairness? Should telic or deontic egalitarianism get priority?  How can we decide this given reasonable disagreement?

Absent unanimous consensus, we need some procedure to reconcile these disagreements.  But using any democratic procedure results in an infinite regress - we need to agree on a procedure to agree on a procedure.  And neither can we consent to them if the results are binding on those who don't consent.
