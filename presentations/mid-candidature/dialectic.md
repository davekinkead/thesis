# A Democratic Dialectic

The terms `liberal` and `democracy` are often used synonymously.  When most people talk about democracy they are typically referring to liberal democracy [^who].  Some philosophers and political theorists [^who] even think that democratic values _are_ liberal values and that liberal ones are democratic.

It's easy to see why liberalism and democracy are so often conflated.  For most of the last 200 years, almost all democracies were in fact liberal democracies.  Conversely, and with very few exceptions, non-democracies were typically illiberal.  The correlation between liberal states and democratic ones is incredibly strong.  Plotting electoral freedoms & political rights against civil liberties as measured by the watch dog group Freedom House, and performing regression analysis shows an r value of 0.9578 for their 2014 dataset, a near perfect correlation.   

Democracy and Liberalism however, are not the same things.  They describe different conceptions relating to individual freedom and political power.  The word democracy is derived from Greek _demos_ and _kratos_, meaning simply _the rule or power of the common people_.  And while it is certainly true that there are many competing conceptions of democracy, a common and essential element of them all is that they describe _who_ wields power in a society, who reigns and who is sovereign.

Liberalism by contrast, is derived from the Latin _liber_ or free person.  It was an antonym of _servus_ or slave. In the republican sense, a liberal was anyone who was free from the oppression of others, and not dependent on the leave of a master.  During the enlightenment, a liberal came to be associated with anyone free from prejudice and intolerance.  These two conceptions of freedom - from oppression and intolerance - characterise liberalism today.  For a society to be considered liberal then, it must respect the personal freedom of its individual members and promote tolerance for differing conceptions of the good.


## Democracy requires constraints

Neither democracy nor liberalism are freestanding conceptions however.  By freestanding here, I mean that both liberalism and democracy by themselves are inherently unstable.  The very ideas and forces that make a society or system of government liberal or democratic simultaneously drive those realisations to being illiberal and undemocratic.

The instability of _naked democracy_ or unchecked majoritarianism has a well documented history.  As political theorists from Aristotle to Acton have observed, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Democracy requires some form of constraint, either procedural or substantive, on it's power in order to survive and remain democratic. Absent constitutional limits or strong political norms, naked democracy tends to degenerate into dictatorship and tyranny.  

> Tyranny naturally arises out of democracy, and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty.  
> -- Plato, The Republic, Book 9

In electoral democracies, representatives unrestrained by the rule of law have a strong individual incentive to repeal constitutional constraints and undermine limits to their power.  History is littered with the debris of once democratic states, whose popularly elected leaders transformed into tyrants once they were elected to power - Mussolini's Italy, Hilter's Germany, Mugabe's Zimbabwe, and Lukashenko's Belarus serving as just a few examples. Democracies then, require some form of constraint to democratic processes if they wish to survive long.


## Liberalism requires reconciliation

Like democracy, liberal theory also lacks the capacity to stand alone.  Liberalism, in whatever form takes, requires the protection of certain beliefs, expressions, and actions from the interference of the state and other citizens.  These protections typically take the form of political and legal rights for individuals and corresponding duties on the state.  Liberalism determines and partitions private rights from public politics, constraining the power of the state to pass laws governing what has been deemed private affairs.  

Protecting and promoting any right however, necessarily comes at the expense of others.  As WN Hohfeld observed, rights are the correlatives of duties [^hohfeld1913].  Any right I may have to _X_ means that others have a duty not to prevent me _X_-ing.  The correlative identity of rights and duties means that general rights to _X_ and not _X_ cannot simultaneously exist if the correlative duties are imposed on the same subjects (typically the state).  As an example, a constitutional constraint that protects a citizens right to carry semi-automatic firearms in public necessarily prevents the existence of right for citizens not to be threatened or intimidated by others carrying said weapons; and rights to absolute free speech necessarily conflict with rights not to be defamed and offended by others.

The realisation of liberalism therefore requires in the prioritisation of certain protections over others.  We must identify our individual rights and determine which are to take priority over others; and specify the balance between free speech and defamation, the bearing of arms and physical safety.  These orderings can be viewed as a set of liberal values - some sets will be more compatible with others.  Some may even represent the optimal set of individual rights compatible with all others.  

> Your right to swing your arms ends just where the other man's nose begins.   
> -- Zechariah Chafee, Jr.

Yet it's the very tolerance that liberalism promotes that results in competing conceptions of the good and corresponding disagreement about which rights should be prioritised over others.  And this pluralism of conceptions is not some mere contingent matter but rather the causal result of liberalism itself.  Different kinds of normative assessments, complex and conflicting empiric evidence, and judgements of relevance that freedom of religion, thought, and speech promote, all contribute to and entail different reasonable yet irreconcilable comprehensive doctrines. This fact of reasonable pluralism is, Rawls claims, "the long run outcome of human reason under free institutions" [^p4], a "permanent feature of democratic public culture" [^p36] and not some "unfortunate condition of human life" [^p37].  

Liberalism requires that some rights be promoted over, and at the expense of, others.  It requires the demarcation of the public sphere from the private realm.  But it also engenders an indeterminism concerning exactly where the public and the private should demarcated.  Without a mechanism to reconcile this inevitable yet reasonable disagreement, nakedly liberal societies, like nakedly democratic ones, are destined to instability.


## Liberalism can't be reconciled democratically

It seems then, that liberalism and democracy should be complementary.  Liberalism offers democracy the means to limit unfettered majoritarianism; and democracy offers liberalism a mechanism to collectively reconcile it's contents.  But when we examine their conjunction, we find a deep and insurmountable challenge.

The conjunction of liberalism with democracy can result in either liberal democracy or democratic liberalism.  In order for one to complement the other, they must necessarily conflict in some way.  If liberalism is not undemocratic in the sense that it limits naked majoritarianism, then it fails to offer democracy its support; and if democratic methods like referenda aren't used to reconcile liberalism's disputed content, then it too fails to perform its assistive role.  So the conjunction will always result in conflict between democratic and liberal values, requiring one to be prioritised over the other.

In a liberal democracy, liberalism is the constraint to democracy



- democracy needs constraints
- liberalism needs reconciliation
- lets combine them!
- can't reconcile liberalism democratically
- can't reconcile liberalism impositionally

so 

- democracy can't reconcile liberalism (if liberalism is to limit democracy)
- liberalism can't limit democracy ()
