> Everyone appreciates a clever mathematical picture, but the prevailing attitude is one of scepticism: diagrams, illustrations, and pictures prove nothing; they are psychologically important and heunstically useful, but only a traditional verbal/symbolic proof provides genuine evidence for a purported theorem. Like some other recent writers (Barwise and Etchemendy [1991]; Shin [1994]; and Giaquinto [1994]) I take a different view and argue, from historical considerations and some striking examples, for a positive evidential role for pictures in mathematics. (p161)

>  a diagram is just a special case and so can't establish a general theorem.

> Though not universal, the prevailing attitude is that pictures are really no more than heuristic devices; they are psychologically suggestive, and peda- gogically important, but they prove nothing.

The general view:

> On this view only proofs give us mathematical knowledge; moreover, proofs are derivations; they are verbal/symbolic entities. Pictures, on the other hand, are psychologically useful, often suggestive, and sometimes downright charming—but they do not provide evidence. (p162)

On Bolzano's 'Purely Analytic Proof'

> We have a continuous line running from below to above x-axis [see diagram]. Clearly, it must cross that axis in doing so. Thus understood, it is indeed a 'trivial' and 'obvious' truth.  (p163)

The fallability of analytic proofs:

> Moreover, proofs are almost never given in full; they are just sketches which give ample scope for committing some of the well known informal fallacies. (p165)

> The verbal/symbolic proof may well explain the theorem, but the picture explains it, too (p165)

Proofs can do one of three things for theorems: (p164-165)

  1. Establish a theorem that was not known to be true as true 
  2. Explain the theorem
  3. Show the theorem confirms the premises of the proof

> Russell, too, expressed the [last] view clearly: 'we tend to believe the premises because we can see that their consequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because we know the premises to be true' (Russell [1907], pp. 273f.) (p165)

> Trying to get along without them [pictures] would be like trying to do theoretical physics without the benefit of experiments to test conjectures. (p165)

> the way the picture works is much like a direct perception; it is not some sort of encoded argument. (p166)

> Let us call any evidence which falls short of an actual traditional proof, 'inductive evidence'. Mathematical achievements may rest entirely on deduc- tive evidence, but mathematical practice is based squarely on the inductive kind. (p167)

> Analytic proofs, after all, are not constructed ex nihilo; they are based on axioms or first principles. But where do these first principles come from? Why do we believe these axioms? (p168)

> Barwise and Etchemendy (who are among the very few sympathetic to the use of pictures in inference) explicitly adopt such a view. They hold that 'a good diagram is isomorphic, or at least homomorphic, to the situation it represents' ([1991], p. 22). (p173)

> Consequently, I claim, some 'pictures' are not really pictures, but rather are windows to Plato's heaven (p174)

Analogies:

> Some with an interest in art and psychology distinguish between a 'pictorial' and a 'symbolic' aspect of a representation (e.g. Arnheim [1969]). (p175)

> Mathematicians look for two things in a proof—evidence and insight. Tradi- tionally, a proof must firmly establish the theorem. That, for just about every- one except Lakatos, is a sine qua non for any proof. But a good proof also helps us to understand what's going on. (p177)

> We simply have to learn how to use them [pictures as proofs], just as we must continue to learn more about microscopes. (p179)

  title = {Proofs Are Programs: 19th Century Logic and 21st Century Computing}
}

> As the 19th century drew to a close, logicians formalized an ideal notion of proof. They were driven by nothing other than an abiding interest in truth, and their proofs were as ethereal as the mind of God. Yet within decades these mathematical abstractions were realized by the hand of man, in the digital stored-program computer. How it came to be recognized that proofs and programs are the same thing is a story that spans a century, a chase with as many twists and turns as a thriller. At the end of the story is a new principle for designing programming languages that will guide computers into the 21st century. For my money, Gentzen’s natural deduction and Church’s lambda calculus are on a par with Einstein’s relativity and Dirac’s quantum physics for elegance and insight. And the maths are a lot simpler. I want to show you the essence of these ideas. I’ll need a few symbols, but not too many, and I’ll explain as I go along. To simplify, I’ll present the story as we understand it now, with some asides to fill in the history. First, I’ll introduce Gentzen’s natural deduction, a formalism for proofs. Next, I’ll introduce Church’s lambda calculus, a formalism for programs. Then I’ll explain why proofs and programs are really the same thing, and how simplifying a proof corresponds to executing a program. Finally, I’ll conclude with a look at how these principles are being applied to design a new generation of programming languages, particularly mobile code for the Internet.

  author = {Porto Andr\'e},
  pages = {44--76}
}

> The present article offers an explanation of perhaps Wittgenstein’s strangest and least intuitive thesis – the semantical mutation thesis – according to which one can never answer a mathematical conjecture because the new proof alters the very meanings of the terms involved in the original question. Instead of basing our justification on the distinction between mere calculation and proofs of isolated propositions, characteristic of Wittgenstein’s intermediary period, we generalize it to include conjectures involving effective procedures as well.

@porto2015 takes @martin-lof1984's [p29] ideas that lamba terms are programs to demonstrate the plausibility of Wittgenstein's _semantical mutation thesis_.  Code is used as an example of the _possible_.

> The  suggestion  is  thus  to  construe  the  rather  abstract-looking lambda-terms very  concretely,  as computer  programs. p54

> I discuss the prospects for new forms of professional communication in philosophy. I argue that online discussions and online surveys ought to play a more important role in commu- nications between philosophers than they play today. However, there are major obstacles to the widespread adoption of these media as channels of communication between academics. I offer an overview of these obstacles and sketch a strategy for surmounting them. The strat- egy I propose involves the development of a new kind of service which could expand the reach of the analytic method in philosophy.

@bourget2010 looks at how digital methods can advance philosophy.

*Online Spaces*

Sub paper length arguments & refutations are currently lost thanks to the current publication mediums [p364] but a lack of prestege in blogs is limiting their use [p365]

> many verbally brief points which are potentially just as valuable as whole papers remain largely uncommunicated to the profession as a whole. [p364]

> I would not be surprised if it turned out that we spend significantly more time and energy on communication difficulties than philosophical problems per se when preparing articles [p364]

@bourget2010 also looks at online surveys and _philosophical registries_ that combine the two [p371]

> It is noteworthy that a registry of the kind sketched here could be particularly well suited to the application of a certain analytic methodology to philosophical problems. In some circles, it is widely believed that philosophical disputes are fuelled in large part by linguistic confusion—either the participants have a poor grasp of the meanings of the words they use, or they have a poor grasp of others’ meanings. On this view, the primary task of the philosopher is to dissipate the fog of language around the ideas under dispute. For most philosophical disputes, the closer we come to accomplishing this, the closer we will come to consensus. [p375]
