~~ Rough Intro ~~

This is an argument about method.  Philosophy is a discipline characterised by methodological pluralism --- there are many ways of doing philosophy.  Many other disciplines have embraced digital methods but philosophy is somewhat a laggard in this respect. This is unfortunate for philosophy.

Computer simulations are a lot like thought experiments _in silico_.  They allow us to model a theory, concept, or representation of reality.  Simulations however, allow us to do much more than thought experiments can --- they provide a capacity for formalisation, precision, complexity, and computation that is unavailable to our native cognitive capacities.  

In this thesis, I advance a new philosophical methodology --- computational philosophy.  Computational philosophy has many similarities to other digital forms of scholarship --- computational biology, computational linguistics, or the digital humanities.  What makes computational philosophy _philosophy_ however, is how technology is applied to scholarship.

I argue that philosophy should embrace computer simulation as a method of argument.  Not merely the supplementary use of simulation to generate data to support some claim, an approach I label _argumentum cum silico_.  Instead, we philosophers should use simulation _as_ argument itself by formalising our assumptions and premises in code, and embedding it within our work itself.  I call this approach _argumentum in silico_. 

In the first half of this thesis, I explore the diverse methods of philosophy and situation computer simulation within the discipline.  In chapter two, I look at how philosophers have used analysis, dialectic, argument, modelling, and finally simulation to explain the universe and justify claims.  

In chapter three, I analyse the nature of computer simulation and show how they are analogous to digital thought experiments.  Simulation offers philosophy deep insights into problem domains characterised by analytic intractable, emergence, complexity, and limited accessibility.  Yet simulation faces its own challenges relating to realism, reliability, and reproducibility.  I advance a method of using _simulation as argument_ which leverages the advantages of computer simulation while avoiding most of the limitations.  Computational philosophy does this with the added advantage of persuasiveness thanks to the potential for visualising results in an interactive and visceral manor.

In the second half of the thesis, I offer three examples of the methodology I propose in order to demonstrate the virtues of _simulation as argument_ as a method.  In chapter four, I use simulation to model an analytically intractable problem in political philosophy.  I explore how the boundary problem of democratic theory, the problem of deciding who to include in a polity, affects different conceptions of political legitimacy and argue that different instrumental justifications of democracy require very different arrangements of citizens which renders some of these justifications, epistemic and utilitarian democracy, largely incompatible with each other.

In chapter five, I apply computational approaches to problems in the history of philosophy.  I demonstrate how _simulation as argument_ can be used as a way to test the coherence of political theories --- in this case Hobbes' Leviathan.  By formalising Hobbes' key assumptions and premises, I show that _warre of all against all_ is not only not inevitable, but also highly unlikely.  A Leviathan is therefore not a rational choice of people in the state of nature.  Yet if we relax some of Hobbes' claims, then a Leviathan does in fact become the only rational choice --- the question for historians of philosophy is then whether or not Hobbes would be prepared to relax those claims.

In chapter six, I move on to applied philosophy and use computational philosophy to analysis an important epistemic claim frequently made in educational research and policy --- that we can infer school performance from student results.  I do this by constructing in idealised causal model of school performance to test the inference against a normative epistemic principle --- that if an inference isn't warranted under ideal conditions, then it can't be warranted in real conditions.  I show that the presence of selectivity in a school system --- the ability of students to choose their school or schools to choose students --- undermines the inference mechanism from student results to school performance.

I conclude my thesis in chapter seven by reflecting the method I have proposed and its relation to philosophy.  Why type of knowledge does simulation provide?  What are its limitations? Is this philosophy? And where to from here?  Some of these questions can be answered by looking to analogous methods like thought experiment.  Others can be answered by comparing computational philosophy as proposed to the digital humanities and other computational disciplines.  Some however, like whether this approach will take hold within philosophy or just fizzle out like a fad, will only be answered in time.
