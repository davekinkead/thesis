## @dahl1970

Dahl defines the Boundary problems as "who should participate in the government of a democratic association" (p60 ) and notes it is "a curiously neglected and yet absolutely crucial problem" (p59) where there is "no theoretical solution to the puzzle, only pragmatic ones" (p59)

  - if democracy means rule by the people, then we need to clarify what we mean by rule and by people
  - how we define the _people_ automatically determines the way in which they can _rule_
  - and how we define _rule_ necessarily sets bounds on how we define _people_

This is distinct from suffrage - which citizens among the people should be permitted to participate.

It is "a problem almost totally neglected by all the great political philosophers who write about democracy" p60

> "Succession is an effort to reconstitute the people into two peoples" p61  "More often than not these debates are settled by force and ratified by history: the philosophers take up where history leaves off" p62

> "Democracy cannot be a single form of authority but a multiplicity of forms." p63

Principle of Affected Interests is typically offered as a solution and "is very likely the best general principle of inclusion that you are likely to find":

> "Everyone who is affected by the decisions of a government should have the right to participate in that government" p64

But what affects my interest depends on subjective factors (p66) which leads to global government and clashes with the criterion of economy.  It does at least provide a prima facie case for those affected.  Alternatively, it requires a different association for every set of affected people.

Dahl describes the issue in terms of democratic coherence but his primary concern is with democratic authority.


## @whelan1983

Whelan outlines the boundary problem as "the logically prior and in some ways more fundamental question of the appropriate constitution of the _people_ or unit within which democratic governance is to be practised." p13

It is not a problem of geographic per se, "but the membership of the democratic body; or citizenry;" p14

He position is "not only that the drawing of boundaries around these units is a significant problem for democratic theory and practice, but that democratic theory itself offers no clear guidance on the matter."  The boundary problem "thus present(s) an important practical limit to the scope of democracy as a method of making collective decisions." p13

> "Democracy is advanced by its advocates as the sole legitimate method for making political decisions..." but the boundary problem "...is insoluble within the framework of democratic theory..." p16 making "controversies over boundaries among the most intractable and bitter types of political conflict." p40

There is also "the second problem that the establishment of boundaries ... generally predetermines the outcomes of substantive political issues." p41

*Argument Outline* (p13)

1. Democracy always makes reference to a determinate community of people who are collectively self-governing. 
2. All democratic theory faces the logically prior question of who the people should be.
3. This problem places an important and practical limit on the scope of democracy as a collective decision making method. Who the people are often determines the outcome of any voting system.

Typical accounts of democracy are participatory, majoritarian or consent based.  But each of these accounts needs to answer the logically prior question of who will participate, who will be counted towards the majority or whose consent is needed. (p14--15)

Boundary drawing and determination of political membership is perhaps the most fundamental political decision. Yet, it is a problem completely insoluble from within the framework of democratic theory. p16

Effective democracies require broad consensus on fundamental matters of inclusion. Their boundaries must be recognised as fair and appropriate. p41

*All-Affected Principle*

Intuitively, all those affected by some policy ought have a voice in making it. (p16) The intuition is clear when burdens are to be imposed but not so clear that those receiving benefits ought have a say in the matter. (p17)

Yet, every decision affects people differently. Constituency would need to be determined on a per issue basis. p19

Deeper still, determining who is affected by an issue requires a prior determination of constituency, which cannot be made by those affected as this is the very question to be settled. p19

*Territorial States*

The people can be defined by historical accident - those in a state are the people. But this can't solve the boundary problem when territorial issues are in dispute.

> "Democracy can be practiced for making collective decisions once the collectivity has been defined, but democratic methods themselves are inadequate to establish the bounds of the collectivity, whose existence democratic theory simple pre-supposes." p22

*Consent*

Constituting by consent would define the people as who ever consents to being one of them.  This is plausible for voluntary organisations but requires unanimity on who is included and who is excluded. p26

But States are territorial and compulsory associations whose agreement is never unanimous. 

*Nationality*

Nationality and ethnicity have also been suggested as ways to demarcate the people - the UN recognises the right of self-determination for peoples.  The objections to these are many:

  - "No single objective criterion of nationality appears definitive." p29
  - States govern many nations of people.
  - State determine nations as much as nations determine states ie the Soviet people, the Yugoslavian people.
  - People may wish to align themselves non-ethnically.
  - The nationalist principle is non-voluntaristic. 

These reasons seem to clash with democratic values such s voluntarism, freedom and rationality. p31

*Geography & Salience*

Human distribution seems to drive grouping and connection. Those closest share common ends. Yet...

Physical features are a matter of perspective. Rivers divide as much as unite communities. Mountains are boarders only to those who live on the plains. p37
Economic patterns develop in response to political boundaries, just as much as they form common bonds. p35


*Autonomy*

Size of a democratic people determines both its citizen effectiveness and system capacity (see Dahl 1973 Size & Democracy).  Yet autonomy suffers the same problem as the all-affected principle - constituting the people on a per-issue basis, or changing them over time.

These other principles fail to 'command general respect' p40


## @dahl1989

This time Dahls describes the problem as the problem of the unit or the question of inclusion.

  1. The Problem of Inclusion: What persons have a rightful claim to be included in the demos?
  2. The scope of its authority: What rightful limis are there on the control of a demos? Is alienation ever morally permissable?

> "The question of inclusion would present a less serious challenge if a demos could enact rules that were only binding on itself." p119  The problem isn't as serious for voluntary associations.

One response is to rely on _contingent citizenship_ - the accidents of history.  This however lacks normative force but it's strongest propoent was Schumpter - the rule of the Soviet Union by the Bolshevik party doesn't make it undemocratic unless the party is rulled undemocratically. This is "truely no solution at all" p121

We can then distunguish: p122

  - a system is democratic in relation to its own demos
  - a system is democratic in relation to everyone subject to its rule

Citizenship can also be viewed as a _categorical right_.

> All those subject to a democracy's rule have a right to participate

Classical and modern scholars such as Mill, Rouseau, and Locke prioritised the contingent over categorical claims. p126

> "The Problem of the Unit"

> To the extent that the unit within which majority rule operates is unjustifiable, then majority rule is unjustifiable in that unit. p193

The problem of the unit breaks down into multiple questions

  - what types of associations should be goverened democratically? The states, corporations, the family?
  - what types of associations should be sovereign? Cities, regions, nations?
  - what level of association should matters be decided? Who decides this?

Dahl charaterises this as two issues: p195

  - scope of control: claims with respect to certain matters, narrow jurisdiction to total soveriegnty
  - domain of persons: which group does the deciding, local area to transnational 

Non-Solutions (p196)

  - peoples define themselves. No substantive grounds for deciding between counter claims
  - political autonomy as an absolute right. Dahl claims this degenerates into anarchism

  > The criteria of the democratic process presuppose the rightfulness of the unit itself (p207)

  Dahl proposes the following criteria for inclusion: (p207-209)

    1. The domain and scope can be clearly identified

    2. The people in the domain strongly desire autonomy

    3. The people in the domain desire democratic self-government

    4. The scope is within justifiable limits

    5. The people within the domain currently have little control over the scope

    6. Consensus within the domain is higher than alternative units

    7. Gains must outway costs

## @held1992

The liberal in Liberal Democracy is not a simply unity. p13

Not really on the Boundary Problem....


## @arrhenius2005

The boundary problem is defined as "Who should be eligible to take part in which decision-making processes?" p1  It is a "fundamental issue in democratic theory" p1 but it is "perhaps not equally clear that the boundary problem raises problem regarding the justification and legitimacy of democracy." p2

His position is that "if we take democracy as a decision method, then Whelan's charge against democratic theory misses its target since it is not supposed to deliver any solution to the boundary problem. If we take democracy as a normative ideal, then there seems to be a promising candidate for a boundary principle: the all affected principle." p14

He highlights a number of related questions: p3

  - "how we should decide the relevant political competence for membership in the political community?"

  - "who should have a right to run for office?"

  - "Another boundary problem concerns beings that lack the capacity to take part in the democratic process but who are going to be affected by policies adopted and that could be represented by proxies, for example minors and future generations"

The argument:

  - There's a difference between a normative ideal and a decision rule
  - A theory can be accepted as a normative ideal but rejected as a decision rule
  - Democracy is one such theory

> "Someone who takes democracy as a practical decision method justified by a normative ideal doesn’t hold that democracy is the foundation of legitimate government but that its legitimacy derives from the ideal." p5

> "If we take democracy as a practical decision method and again raise the question of who should take part in which decision procedures, it seems clear that this has to be answered by the normative ideal that motivated the choice of democracy in the first place" p7

> So it appears that instrumental accounts of democracy aren't bothered by the regress objection.

> "if we see the all affected principle as part of a democratic ideal, then whether or not a decision is democratic, or whether it is more or less democratic, will depend on some conception of “relevantly affected”" p9

When taken as a normative ideal rather than a decision mechanism, the All-Affected Principle overcomes Whelan's objections. p12  Affected Interest could have some causal constraint that suggests a federal structure and objectively optimal jurisdiction boundaries.

Nozick as an interesting counterpoint to the all affected principle

> If four men propose marriage to a woman, her decision about whom ... to marry importantly affects each of the lives of those four persons, her own life, and the lives of any other person wishing to marry one of these four men, and so on. Would anyone propose, even limiting the group to include only the primary parties, that all five persons vote to decide whom she shall marry?  
>
> -- Nozick "Anarchy, State, and Utopia" p269

He does however acknowledge the all affected principle fits well with democratic conceptions that concern distribution of influence or power e.g. epistemic democracy. p14


## @bergström2007

Bergström defines the boundary problem as "if ”democracy” is government “by the people”, who are included among “the people”?" p1

His claim is that democratic theory can solve the boundary problem but that "a democratic solution is not necessarily a good solution."  And while we could try and find _good_ non-democratic solutions, "according to democratic theory political problems should be handled by democratic methods, not by normative principles." p24

> "democratic theory has ... started from the implicit assumption that the boundary problem is solved – or can be ignored – in practice." p4

> "even if there is no suitable and general principle for the solution of boundary problems, it might be still held that such problems can nevertheless be solved by democratic methods in particular cases" p5

> "This indicates that there are really two different kinds of boundary problems. One kind consists of decision problems, which are solved when certain decisions are made – at least if they are made by the relevant political authority in accordance with the relevant rules of decision making. The other kind consists of normative problems, which are solved when someone finds out what decision ought to be made or ought to have been made in a certain case or kind of case." p7

Just because a decision can be reached through a democratic process, doesn't mean that the decision is the right one, nor that a problem has been solved.  The issue is why we should be morally bound by democratic outcomes.

> "I conclude that the all-affected principle is quite unacceptable as a general rule for all political decisions. However, it might still be acceptable in the particular case of decisions concerning boundary problems." p14

> "we are concerned with the problem of finding some practically useful way of handling boundary problems." p17

He hints that a solution to the BP must be congruent with the aims of democracy. p21

> "The claim that the boundary problem cannot be solved within democratic theory can be understood in different ways. On one rather natural interpretation it is false. So Dahl and Whelan are wrong." p23

> "Moral philosophers have a tendency to believe that normative problems can be solved by normative principles. Unfortunately, this is a very problematic assumption. In political contexts, it is probably often mistaken. Fortunately, there are other ways of handling political problems." p24


## @goodin2007

Goodin defines the boundary problem as "How do we specify the group making those decisions?" but prefers to call it the problem of “constituting the demos.” p40 

His position is that the "democratic ideal ought ideally be to enfranchise “all affected interests.” Understood in a suitably expansive “possibilistic” way, that would mean giving virtually everyone everywhere a vote on virtually everything decided anywhere." p68

Bob argument is:

  - procedures can still be democratic if they realise democratic ideals
  - the all potentially affected interest principle realises democratic ideals of equality
  - an expansive interpretation entails a global democracy
  - a restrictive interpretation entails trans-border compensation for externalities

Democracy can be defined semi-circularly as "groups of people making collective decisions in a democratic way." p40

> "“Constituting the demos” is therefore a problem that finds no ready solution, either within democratic theory or in any of the seemingly cognate areas of political philosophy." p42

> "The natural place to look for a solution is indeed in the vicinity of democratic theory itself, and I shall argue that we can indeed find one there — but not without some surprises along the way." p42

> "Until we have an electorate we cannot have an election. That is not just a temporal observation; it is a logical truth......like saying the winning lottery ticket will be pulled out of the hat by the winner of that selfsame lottery" p43

> "The need to appeal to some principle outside democracy to constitute the demos does not render democratic theory incoherent, merely incomplete." p44

Empiric answers are difficult: "More generally, unless we know what the right way to constitute the demos is in the first place, we have no way to know whether any given empirical tendencies within democratic politics will, as this argument asserts, lead them to (re)constitute the demos in precisely the right way." p45

> "Constituting a demos on the basis of shared territory or history or nationality is thus only an approximation to constituting it on the basis of what really matters, which is interlinked interests" p49

> "The “all affected interests” principle is the standard by which the adequacy of those other approximations is invariably assessed." 49

> "Protecting people’s interests is thus the most plausible candidate principle for bringing the “who” and the “how” of democratic politics into alignment." p50

> "the “all affected interests” principle is fundamentally egalitarian, counting all interests equally; and equal political power is arguably the cornerstone of democracy....What matters is that constituting the demos in that way is consonant with our settled views about what it is to “make collective decisions in a democratic way” at the procedural level." p50

On acutal affected interests: "which interests are “actually affected” depends on who gets to vote. Hence it is incoherent to try to deter- mine who should get to vote by asking whose interests are actually affected by the course of action actually decided upon." p53

> "More generally, you are rightly said to be “affected,” not merely by the “course of action actually decided upon,” but also by the range of alternative courses of action from which that course was chosen. Further- more, you are rightly said to be “affected,” not merely by what the consequences of that decision actually turn out to be, but also by what the consequences might have turned out to be" p54

> "By embracing all possible worlds, politically, this expansive conception of “all possibly affected interests” causes the franchise to balloon dramatically and the scope for legitimate exclusions to shrink accordingly." p55

> "Even if, per the “all affected interests” principle, we give a vote to everyone who is affected, that does not necessarily imply that the demos is empowered to decide by voting upon everything that affects its members." p62

So we can restrict the scope of democratic action on only those affected - "The “all affected interests” standard can thus be satisfied in either of two ways. One is by expanding the franchise, giving a say to all those who would be affected. Another is by restricting the power of the demos, so it is only allowed to make decisions that affect only those who do have a say." p63

The constraining version could be realised with a "not “no spillovers” but, rather, “no uncompensated spillovers.” p 66

> "Purely as a matter of democratic third best, the price of not enfranchising everyone we ideally should is that we would have to pay them off for any harms we inflict upon them and accede to their demands for fair recompense for any benefits we derive from the wrongfully disenfranchised." p68


## @miller2009

Miller defines the problem as "who should be included in the _demos_,  or constituency when democratic decisions are taken" p201 or "how should the political units within which democracy will be practiced be constituted?" p202

It is a question primarily about people rather than territory and is driven by three primary concerns: p202  

  - transnational or global democracy
  - political seccession 
  - immigration

It is not obvious that democracy is any help on this issue. "Ateempts to propose criteria from the outside simply reveal a disagreement about what makes a person fit to participate in democratic politics" p202

This might be because "there is no simple entailment from democratic principles to the choice of political unit...or it might mean that the criteria ... are not themselves democratic." p203

Two reasons we should try and solve the BP with a democratic approach: p203

 - without democracy, we become emeshed in controversy as non-democratic substantive ideals are hotly contested.
 - there is inutitive discomfort with an abitrary approach from the democratic perspective.

Democratic solutions are only circular if we limit our view of democracy as procedural.   While there is no reason to believe majority voting from arbitrary boundaries will settle into an acceptable equalibrium, democratic values can also be used. See @arrhenius2005 on conflating process and ideals. p204

If we want to solve the BP with democratic ideals, we need to be clear on what they are.  Miller describes two conceptions of democracy - Liberal and Radical: p205

  - L-democrats understand democracy in instrumental terms "democracy serves freedom by protecting members of the demos from domination, and that democracy promotes welfare by ensuring that political decisions track the aggregate interests of its constituency."

  - R-democrats understand democracy in intrinsic terms "the idea of collective self-determination and stands at the heart of democratic theory".  It is not only the outcomes that are important but the manor in which they are achieved.

LD concerns of constituency will primarily relate to impact of decisions. RD concerns of constituency will primarily relate to to the quality of the demos itself. p206

RD concerns suggest exclusion:

  - mutual solidarity and identification is easier in small homogeneous groups. p208
  - underlying agreement on ethical issues is necessary for cohesion. p208
  - interpersonal trust between citizens is needed. p209
  - the group must be stable over time. p209

But there are a number of reasons RD's would want more inclusion:

  - small polities may be internally effective but lack external impact or system capacity. p210
  - decision quality is higher when people are free to express dissenting views. p209

LD concerns point to inclusion:

  - unless completely homogeneous, multiple group identities make oppression by a majority less likely. p211
  - segmentation means dominant views in one area can be opposed in another. p211

But the counter reasons towards exclusion are:

  - Mill's "free institution" are only possible in societies whose member shared a common national identity. p211
  - respect for law and dissent are only possible when common sympathies create sufficient solidarity between groups. p212

So far, Miller's analysis has looked internally to the demos.  But democracy also has external effects. "As I suggested earlier, the effect of considering impact is likely to be to give democracy a more inclusionary push - to expand the demos so that it includes more of those who will bear the impact of its decisions" p213

Two key principles are the affected-interests and coercion principles.  It's possible to be affected without being coerced but not vice versa. p214

Only LD's are concerned by affected interests but both "must respond when the coercion principle comes into play,because the normal effect of coercion is to undermine  personal autonomy,  while protecting autonomy is central to
both conceptions of democracy". p214

Miller lists four problems with the affected-interest principle:

  - affect depend on the question which leads to circularity or universality p215
  - the interaction between domain (which people) and scope (which issues) p216
  - affect occurs in different degrees p216
  - affect doesn't normally seem to entail a right to participate p218

> "Widening the demos may change its character and/or the decision procedures it uses, and these in turn will alter the quality of the decisions takes, and their impact on different groups of people .... The circularity problem runs deep."

Coercion on the other hand has the following characteristics: p219

  - intended to realise the will of a coercer
  - compliance is non-voluntary
  - pressure is used to achieve compliance.
  - undermined the autonomy of those coerced (they become an instrument of the coercer's will)
  - some other course of action must be taken

Coercion differs from prevention.  Miller has a poor example on p220

> "I have that what is distinctive about coercion is suggested normatively that it undermines the autonomy of the person coerced" p221

The web of laws in a democratic state is sufficiently coercive to require justification because the coercion is unavoidable. "Their unavoidable coercion can only be made legitimate by the opportunity they have to influence those decisions." p222

> "being coerced by a demos does generate a claim for inclusion that is far stronger than any claim that the affected interests principle is likely to generate" p225

Miller offers some solutions:

  - have democratic states commit themselves to not coercing outsiders. p222
  - give outsiders a non-binding say on issues that effect them p223

The BP requires striking a balance between an internally functioning demos and its external effects, and this balance will be swayed by whether one is an L or R democrat. p226

> "Wherewe already have a well-functioning democracy, this is a prima facie reason not to alter its domain" p227

To solve the BP, we need to ask:

  - how well do prevailing systems perform p226
  - do changes improve internal functioning p227
  - do changes reduce negative externalities p227
  - can externalities be limited internally (by removing these issues from the internal domain) p227

  "there can be no algorithm for deciding whether any proposed shift of domain represents a democratic gain or a democratic loss." p227

  "Instead they are questions that must be debated within existing demoi whenever proposals for altering boundaries appear on the agenda" p228

> "One reason for thinking that domain questions can only be resolved internally is that each demos will have its own conception of democracy" p228


## @agné2010


> "democratic founding is paradoxical because of the difficulty or even inability of the people to decide democratically on who they are" p382

He describes the logic of Boundary Problem as: 

> "Since democracy means rule by the people, there can be no democracy prior to the delimitation of a people; and since there can be no democracy prior to the delimitation of a people, the delimitation of the people cannot itself be democratically decided, according to this argument." p382

His thesis is "that some people are excluded from the politics of deciding who the people are, is not a logical predicament inherent in all founding decisions." p382

It is only problematic when those "who will be excluded from the political order once founded are not allowed to influence the boundary drawing in the same ways as are they who will be included." p382

> "a political order or community founded through procedures which provide equal participation to people who will live within as well as beyond the political order once founded is not created in any perplexing opposition to the concept of democracy from which the paradox of founding emanated in the first place" p382

> "The founding of political orders or com- munities is democratic if and only if decided in procedures that give equal opportunities of participation to people who will live within as well as beyond the boundaries inherent in the foundation.1 In short, the paradox of founding does not exist in global democracy." p383

Why ideal theory matters:

> "opening one’s eyes to the ignored theoretical possibilities of procedural democracy has significant consequences for thinking about real-world politics." p384

Agné outlines 3 approaches to founding democracies:

  - nationalist
  - contractualist
  - substantivist

The Nationalist doesn't address the issue because relies on a pre-democratic claim to justify the people, which cannot justify democracy. p385

The problem with unanimous consent is:

> "In the vision of social contract theory, the founding of legitimate, or even democratically legitimate, states has been seen to consist in a unanimous vote among the contracting parties" p386

> "adherence to unanimous voting does not address the objec- tion that the group of people who were permitted to participate in the unanimous decision could and perhaps should have been composed in some other way – most importantly that someone who was in fact excluded should actually have been included" p386

> "it is undemocratic to delimit the people through a political process which begins with the exclusion of some people." p387

> "the ideas of voluntary association and unanimous voting do not overcome the founding paradox in democratic theory" p387

Substantivist approaches justify a people with reference to specific outcomes of people forming such as: p388

  - the all affected principle
  - identity
  - maximising autonomy
  - restoring justice

But there will always be disagreement on which substantive principle.

> "a convincing solution to the problem of inclusion can, within a pluralist society, make no recourse to a ‘transparent objectivity of ultimate moral insights’" p388

On a global solution:

> "When the boundaries of a state are about to be decided, the first option is to make the decision at a political level that is agreeable to people within and beyond the boundaries about to be decided" p389

> "However, if there is permanent division over who should make the decision, we must identify a political procedure whose democratic legitimacy is safe from objections that the procedure operates on an illegitimate policy of exclusion." p389

If the deciding of territorial divisions is done globally, then the exclusion objection doesn't hold.

> "Humanity is not just another group of human beings. It is all of them together. By defining the founding category as inclusive of the whole world, no one will be excluded." p390

Agné calls this the "global principle of democratic founding" p391

> "usefulness in democratic theory presupposes not only logical possibility but also normative justifiability." p391

He claims the GPDF solves many normative challenges:

> "Non-voluntary exclusion occurs when a state is founded through political procedures that exclude people who want to be included in that procedure." p392

Why should everyone get a say in where borders are draw?

> "other prospective citizens cannot simply reject his or her claim to inclusion. Such a rejection would presuppose, contrary to the situation at hand, that the composition of the citizenry had already been decided." p392

> "A cosmopolitan in Africa who fights for a world state may contest the division of European states into smaller ones because it moves his or her world in the wrong direction. A nationalist in Asia may for inverted reasons contest regional integration in the Americas." p392

But what if some people simply didn't want to cooperate with others, if they preferred a more intimate demos?  Why does the claim of some for forced participation outweigh the claim of others for autonomy?

> "The problem of non-voluntary inclusion arises when some people are part of a state, or a global political order, from which they want to be excluded." p396

Everyone has the right but not the obligation to participate.

> "in a politics of founding, none of the competing positions on what political communities exist or should exist must be privileged by the political procedure itself; otherwise, the procedure would not observe the democratic criterion of neutrality between alternatives" p397

A key claim:

> "Basically, GPDF gives to everyone the right to live under democratic rule but no right to live on a territory cleansed from unwanted people." 

> " It presumes, in my view correctly, that democratic rights (such as freedom of speech and political assembly, equality in political and legal procedures) are not violated by people having to share territory with others they hate." p398

But this clearly precludes a right to self-determination as the identification of a collective self is largely dependent on others.



## @owen2012



## @abizadeh2012

Abizadeh defines the boundary problem as "determining who is a member of the collectivity that legitimately exercises political power" or "What is the prepolitical ground for determining the boundaries of the human collectivity that legitimately exercises power (and over whom power is legitimately exercised)" p868

His argument is that "once we recognize that the demos is in principle unbounded, and abandon the quest for a prepolitical ground of legitimacy, can democratic theory fully avoid this collapse of demos into nation into ethnos. But such a theory departs radically from traditional theory." p867

> "My thesis is that only a recognition that the demos is in principlesiple unbounded can yield a coherent theory of democratic legitimacy." p868

Democratic theory seeks  "to legitimize political power by rendering it compatible with the freedom of those over whom it is exercised."  It is "a self-referential theory of political legitimacy...[whose] principle of legitimacy refers right back to the very persons over whom political power is exercised." p867

> "Self-referential theories necessarily combine two questions that are in principle distinct....question of legitimacy...[and]...the question of boundaries" p867

> "The striking feature of self-referential theories is that a second question must consequently be addressed before the question of legitimacy can be determinately answered. " p867

So "if legitimization requires ... prepolitical grounds, then the grounds for adjudicating those boundaries ... must also be prepolitical..." but "...it is impossible consistently and jointly to solve the two problems that self-referential theories combine." p868

The descriptive question ask "what legitimates political power in a particular society?" the normative question asks "what legitimizes political power as such, by reference to a rationally defensible principle of legitimacy?"

Cultural nationalism relies on ethnic considerations pp869-873

> "We need to know who is _legitimately_ in or out because self-referential doctrines purport to furnish a ground for legitimizing political power, and constituting political boundaries is one of the most important ways in which political power is exercised over persons" p873

> "Thus political power is legitimized not by tradition, not by virtue, not by genealogy, but by the demos itself." .... "Specifying the ground for democratic legitimacy therefore clearly re- quires specifying both (a) what procedures give legiti- mate expression to the people’s collective will and (b) who the people in question is." p874

> "It is a problem that arises precisely because the democratic principle of legitimacy is not only self-referential, but also constitutively political: It assumes that the ground of legitimacy is the people’s politically expressed collective will, itself some function of individual members’ wills."p874

> "If laws must be the outcome of certain kinds of procedures, then the democratic legitimacy of the laws governing the procedures themselves seems to face the same kind of infinite regress as boundaries." p874  "Which political procedures legitimately articulate the will of the people cannot itself be wholly determined by interrogating the people’s will." p875

Social contract theory is an "utter failure as a response to the boundary problem..." because "civic boundaries pose an externality problem" on outsiders and require the consent of everyone.  "Boundaries require not just consent, but serial consent." p875

> "_bounded demos thesis_ -- the fact that the people is bounded is given prior to the exercise of political power and independent of any individual’s will." ... "For these theorists, the boundary problem is supposed to demonstrate that legitimizing particular boundaries requires turning to a principle external to democratic theory itself" p876

## @schaffer2012

Schaffer defines the problem as "how to delimit the political community relevant for democracy." p2

His argument is against the all affected principle - that it "does not actually give any guidance for delineating a political community but that it does give some absurd recommendations if we were to try to approximate it in political decision making." p3

It's appeal is obvious - "the all-affected principle seems to expound some classical democratic notions about autonomy and consent...." Aristotle's "ruling and being ruled in turn"....Roman law "what concerns all, all must discuss and approve" ... "liberty means living according to laws that you have given yourself" p3

But the AAP requires a complementary theory about affectedness - this might be an objective claim or subjective one.  One definition could be "you are affected when something bad happens to you through no fault of your own." p4

However, "different people will count as affected by the same decision depending on which theory of affectedness we choose" p5

Also (incorrectly) notes that the AAP results in a regress (but this only occurs when attempting to solve the BP with a democratic procedure) p8

The AAP does however result in fickle boundaries - different jurisdictions for each issue. p9  This threatens democratic rights as these are dependent on political equality _within_ units. p10

The all-affected principle has two components: to participate in making a decision and to be affected by that decision.... "the all-affected principle is equally satisfied if you participate in making a decision that affects you or if you do not participate in making a decision that does not affect you." p11

Agne's maximal autonomy principle: p15

> that people be included in political procedures to the extent that their inclusion yields the greatest amount of autonomy to the greatest number of people, while accounting for both those whose who are included and those who are excluded, and accounting for actions performed both individually and collectively.

> "borders by their very nature affect both those who are included and those who are excluded, a conceptual feature of borders that the all-affected principle cannot escape" p15

One consequence however is it becomes " legitimate to rob some people of their autonomy to maximise aggregate autonomy for everyone" p16

> "Democratic autonomy implies living by laws that you have given yourself and having means by which to assert your interests against the government." p17

> "This subject- to-the-law principle, as I call it, solves some, if not all, of the problems that follow from the all-affected principle." p17 - No it doesn't, it completely ignore the issue of who should be subjected in the first place!

> "Neither of the three alternatives considered here solve the fundamental boundary problem in democratic theory, but they all advance upon the indeterminate all-affected principle. The subject-to- the-law principle seems to be least problematic, substantiating a precise claim: that any already existing lawgiver should be democratically governed by those subject to the laws it issues." p21

Perhaps the problem is unsolvable "these attempts to solve the boundary problem demonstrate that it is unsolvable in principle: a community cannot lift itself by the hair and provide its own democratic justification" ... "we can still solve boundary problems in both theory and practice, but we cannot always justify such solutions in terms of democratic principles." p22

On Chris Brown: p22

> “Politics is about practical action in a realm where no answer can be other than provisional, not about the application of formulae concerning matters such as social justice – and it ought not to be surprising that when formulaic approaches are made to subjects such as the legitimacy of borders the argument quite soon breaks down.”


## @saunders2012

Saunders defines the boundary problem as the issue of who is to be included concerns both spatial outsiders and internal exclusions. p295

He criticizes the ‘all-affected principle’ and the claim that we must enfranchise almost everyone in almost every decision.

Saunders' key claims are: (p281)

- that we should focus on rights rather than mere interests,
- that rights are better respected by limiting the power of groups to infringe them, rather than by requiring them to include or enfranchise the rights-holders

His conclusion is that the boundary problem can be solved by accepting an arbitrary demos but limiting their scope by preventing negative externalities according to some non-democratic moral principle.

This is because "individuals may be understood as waiving certain rights where they are part of a democratic group, thus explaining why groups are able to affect their members in ways that they cannot legitimately affect outsiders." p281

History: Carl Cohen(1971:41–54), JackLively(1975:10–12), Frederick G. Whelan (1983), Giovanni Sartori (1987: 21–5), and Robert A. Dahl (1989: 119–31, 1990: 45–51). Abizadeh (2008) Arrhenius (2007) and Goodin (2007).

> "Until we know the relevant group of decision-makers, it seems that there is no prospect of a genuinely democratic decision." p281

> "There is no need for a decision-making group to include all who are affected by a decision." p281

> "It is frequently claimed that (1) it is unjustifiable for one group to impose costs on outsiders unilaterally, so (2) those outsiders ought to be included in the decision-making process. I will argue that, while the first claim is true, the second does not follow and ought to be rejected." (p282)

All Affected Principle: "I believe it is most charitably interpreted as the claim that all those whose interests are affected ought to be enfranchised." p283

Over inclusiveness is a problem because:

- unaffected votes are _not_ likely to vote randomly. Problems like racism abound. p284
- it suggests enfranchising everyone inc children & the insane
- those unaffected can't be trusted to abstain when they should
- "dilutes the power of the locals to govern their own lives" p286

> "Moral agents are actors, capable of deliberate, reasoned choice, and bound by moral requirements. Moral patients, conversely, are simply those beings deserving of moral consideration. On most views, all moral agents are also moral patients, but the reverse does not hold." p286

> "Rule in the interests of the people (or affected patients) is not democracy, but guardianship. Democracy is essentially a matter of rule by the people, that is, a matter of their agency" p287

> "Democracy is not simply about the equal satisfaction of different parties’ interests, but about giving people equal (and positive) inputs into what the decisions are. This is why choosing a course of action by lottery, though it shows equal respect for all people’s interests, is not democratic (see Estlund, 2008: 65–84; Goodin, 2004: 99)." p288

> "It seems that democracy is, in some sense, a matter of collective agency. " p288

> "Democracy is based on respecting people as agents, rather than merely as patients." p288

> "All might subscribe to the democratic process because it gives weight to their preferences. They may lose on any given decision, but at least they have a chance of winning next time." p289

> "Democratic arrangements are one form of social interaction that impose particular costs on particular agents on particular occasions, but can be justified because in general they are beneficial to all." p289

> "Agents normally face limits on what they can permissibly do. I cannot simply push past you because I am in a rush, for example. Similar limits apply also to collective agents." p289 - this strikes me as a completely incorrect assumption. What can't I push past you, what makes it wrong?

The imposition of costs to insiders is acceptable because they gain 'net benefits in the long term'. This is not true of outsiders. p290

> "Thus, the decision-making power of the demos ought to be limited to distributing benefits and burdens internally and not to affecting outsiders (negatively, at least)." p290

> "The decisional power of a group need not, therefore, be limited to what does not affect outsiders, but only to what does not harm outsiders." p290

> "we need not enfranchise outsiders in a decision simply because we could benefit them" p290

> "there are some things that I have the right to do, even if others are adversely affected by my decision" such as business competition. p291

Acknowledges his major problem - "Of course, in practice we will need mechanisms to determine what rights people have. These will presumably be undemocratic, because we cannot have a democratic process without a prior determination of who should be included in that process, which merely opens a regress." p291

Compensation may be a viable alternative to inclusion or enfranchisement "If our action infringes on the domain of others’ rights, then we need to obtain their consent. Note that this need not take the form of including them in our democratic procedure." 292

> "Simply including someone in a democratic process is not itself sufficient to allow the overriding of their rights." - Very good point p293

> "Including someone in the process of decision-making does not necessarily entitle us to override their rights." p293

> "Thus, it seems (1) that groups have the right to act as their members see fit, provided that they do not violate the rights of any outsiders, regardless of whose interests may be affected, and (2) that groups ought to be prohibited from violating rights without permission." p293

> "If democracy requires all members of the community to be willing to bear short-term losses for the benefit of others, democratic arrangements are likely to function more smoothly where the people are united by a sense of solidarity." p294


## @song2012

Song defines the boundary problem as the question of "who are the people? How is the demos constituted and by what authority?" p39

Her position is cosmopolitan approaches to the boundary problem "are insufficiently attentive to the conditions of democracy. Democracy is not merely a set of procedures; it also consists of substantive values and principles." p39

> "Whelan is [only] right that we are caught in a vicious circle _if_ we assume that democracy is purely procedural" p42

The Argument:

  1.  Affected Interest (AI) & Subject to Coercion (SC) view democracy as overly procedural
  2.  Democracy also includes ideals like political equality and solidarity
  3.  AI & SC undermine those ideals by creating problems of size and stability.
  4.  Therefore AI & SC are not suitable basis for bounding the demos.

She then outlines three considerations for bounding the demos: (p39)

  1. securing the constitutive conditions of democracy, 
  2. serving as the primary site of solidarity conducive to democratic participation, and 
  3. establishing clear links between representatives and their constituents.

Typical accounts that legitimate the people include:

  - nationalism (see Walzer 1985)
  - history (see Nasstrom 2007)
  - affected interests (see Shapiro 1999, Young 2000, Gould 2004, Goodin 2007)
  - subject to coercion (see Lopez-Guerra 2005, Abizadeh 2008)

Defining the demos as the state is both over and under inclusive. Over, because many not affected are given a say & under because resident aliens are not. p40

> She calls AI & SC "democratic principles of inclusion" (p40) but they would be better characterised as cosmopolitan.

Normative core of democracy includes ideals as well as processes. AI & SC accounts treat democracy as procedural. p41

Political equality & solidarity are normative cores of democracy that are adversely affected by the AI & SC. p43

> "The fundamental moral presumption of democracy is that no person is intrinsically superior to another" p43

> "Democracy is a collective decision making process subject to the condition of equality" p43

  - but is the equality required amongst all those subject to law or merely those who make the law?
  - does this require equality between ruler and subject?

Political equality requires protecting equal rights and liberties and ensuring equal opportunities for political influence.

The ideal deliberative procedure seeks to filter nonpublic claims from claims orientated to the common good. p44

Deliberative accounts are based on the exchange of reasons acceptable to others with different views and require the protection of nonpolitical rights as a constitutive element of democracy. p45

She makes an interesting distinction between liberal (hypothetical)justifications and democratic (actual) justifications of coercion. p51

The size of a polity inversely affects the solidarity of its people. p55  As well its stability. p56  These concerns undermine democratic solidarity.

> "What the affected interests and coercion principles actually require is different demoi for different decisions." p56

Mutual trust and solidarity "provide a prima facie case for a territorial answer to the boundary problem." p59

> AI & SC are highly inclusionary and uneven. People are affected differently.  But democratic equality requires equal voice. Thus they are incompatible.

> Song completely misses the point.  Yes the demos should be bounded by the state but she doesn't explain which state should bound which demos!


## @erman2014

Erman's paper is a simple conditional: if democracy is a normative ideal, then any solution to the boundary problem must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy.

She defines the issue as "The problem of who should be included in this collective and thus take part in the collective democratic decision-making, ... is called the boundary problem in democratic theory" p535

Her position is that "the ideal of democracy – ...democracy as collective self-determination (the ‘rule by the people’) is intrinsically justified as the ultimate foundation of legitimate authority" and that "the so-called ‘equal influence principle’ is preferable to solutions drawing on what is commonly called ‘the all affected interests principle’" p535

So "to the extent that we wish to hold on to democracy as a normative ideal when approaching the boundary question about justified inclusion (the ‘B question’), whatever solution we come up with, it must be compatible with the basic conditions of democracy (the ‘C question’, i.e. what conditions must an arrangement fulfil in order to be democratic?)." p535

> "On the narrower exogenous view, the boundary problem is considered to be a question to which democratic theory is not supposed to offer an answer" p535

> "On the broader endogenous view, by contrast, the boundary question is seen as internal to democratic theory in the sense that answers to this question also rest on democratic theory" p535

She extends the All Coerced Principle

> "The equal influence principle states that ‘all those who are systematically and over time subjected to the exercise of political power (authority) and to its laws, political decisions and rules, should systematically and over time have an equal influence in the decision making’" p536 

The C question needs to come first vice other theorists.

> "Most importantly, from the fact that the B question is causally and empirically prior, it does not follow that it is also normatively prior." p536

> "if we adopt the broader endogenous view of democratic theory when approaching the B question, we need a pair of ‘democratic glasses’, specifying at least the basic requirements for an arrangement to qualify as minimally democratic (answering the C question), in order to know where to look" p536

> "equal decision power also involves what we might call a ‘teleological’ dimension, in that people rule over themselves only if they, at least a sufficient number of them, act politically by ‘exercising’ their political equality." p536

Democracy requires that people bind themselves equally to each other. p536

> "it is not clear how [all-affected-interests] is able to get us from a conception of moral equality in terms of counting all interests equally, to political equality in terms of the equal political power." p536

> "Hence, while the all affected principle might be used as a justification of democratic borders as part of a moral theory, e.g. a theory of justice, it is difficult to see how it can translate by itself its moral egalitarian underpinnings into equal political influence." p536

Contexts of interdependent interests: the "circumstances in which the realization of nearly all of the fundamental interests of a person is connected with the realization of nearly all fundamental interests of others" p541

> "The condition of interdependent interests on my account does not justify any normative criteria of democratic inclusion – this work is done by the equal influence principle – it only justifies the applicability of democracy as a normative ideal." p541

interdependent interests place a constraint on over inclusion.  

The all-affected interest principle may not justify suffrage or inclusion but it does justify consideration.

> "In sum, on the defended account, political legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the principle of political legitimacy, which is applicable in contexts of arbitrary rule, while democratic legitimacy requires the fulfilment of the equal influence principle, which is applicable in contexts of interdependent interests" p543

Erman's argument has very strong parallels with @song2012's but suffers the same objections.
 
  - all affected principle ignores the conditions of democracy
  - democracy requires equality and equality demands a different prinicple
  - both however, fail to answer the question of who should be bounded by what


## @espejo2014

Espejo defines the Boundary Problem as "Who are the people who should govern themselves in a democracy?" p466

> "the boundary problem is even deeper than the theorists of both people and territorial rights had acknowledged." p467

She argues that both statist and cosmopolitan arguments "share an important problem: without acknowledging it, they both ultimately delimit the demos by relying on territory" p466

> "both theories ultimately are committed, whether will- ing or not, to seeing people and territory as existing in a tight circular relationship. " p467

> "Both positions displace the unexamined assumption that had caused problems (the people) towards a sec- ond unexamined assumption that now bears the weight of indeterminacy (territory)" p467

Relying on territory to define the people is highly problematic because democratic theory says nothing about territory.

"it turns out that the leading solutions to the boundary problem are incomplete and fall into paradox." p467

Her second argument is that "democratic theory should explicitly analyze territory when dealing with the boundaries of the democratic people" p467

The best approach to solving the BP is to dissolving the circularity of it. p467

Her explaination: ^1 p467

>  Equality requires that all those individuals ruled democratically have a right to participate in creating and transforming the basic institutions that rule them, because otherwise they would not be treated equally. Yet, this commitment is incompatible with a second democratic commitment: popular rule. According to the first commitment, all individuals should be allowed to participate in creating institutions of rule. According to the second, the people is a basic institution of rule. The commitments are incompatible because a democratic decision to create the people generates an infinite regress. Hence, democracy is incoherent. This is the problem of popular indeterminacy.

Most democratic theorists don't view the BP as a problem because they see inclusion derived from non-democratic principle ie equality or liberty.

> "So the key to solving the indeterminacy problem is finding a decision-independent criterion, one which is compatible with democratic principles of equal freedom but not set by a political decision in which the people is entitled to participate, so as to avoid the regress." p468

She demarcates statist views as a bounded demos, and cosmopolitan views as an unbounded demos.

Nationalist/culturalist accounts say that _peoples_ form pre-politically. But there are no clear criteria for national/cultural inclusion so the matter becomes a political one. "But if we need a democratic ruling on this matter, then culture is not decision-independent" p468

Cosompolitans by contrast "addresses the indeterminacy problem by making the people’s boundaries irrelevant in principle." They typcially use the All-Affected Principle but this too results in disagreement and must be answered politically (or universally), making it decision-dependent as well. p468

Even in a universal demos, there are those that would prefer local self-determination. This can only be decided politically (or by imposition).

> "some cannot make a crucial political decision of institutional design on behalf of others without undermining the principle of equality." p469

She distinguishes "the problem of the unit (defining the population from which the citizenry is drawn) with the problem of the demos (establishing a criterion of exclusion from the citizenry" p469

> "“independent” criteria currently available in the literature are not, in fact, decision-independent; they still suffer from the indeterminacy problem." p469

On the cirularity of defining territory and peoples - "the paradox of people and territory.

> "the people [are] to be demarcated in terms of well-defined territory and that their counterpart theories of territorial rights tacitly assume that territories are to be demarcated in terms of well-defined peoples" p473

On paradoxes: 

> "Those paradoxes have the same structure as the one we are discussing: they seem to show that some normative assumptions used to legitimize rule either contradict each other or are incom- patible with reality." p473

They can be dealt with by either asserting, circumventing, solving, or dissolving them.

Assert - "we would conclude that territorial rights are not compatible with liberal democ- racy, and hence we must choose between those two ideals" or "accept that democracy and territorial rights are incompatible, thus accepting that the democratic state is unavoidably illegitimate." p473

Circumvent - "the problems of membership cannot be dealt with democratically, but all other such problems are susceptible to democratic decisions." but "the solution only works when people and territories are in fact stable" p474

Solve - promising but "there is no guarantee that the actual political processes that ground the state are normative." p474

Disolve - "Relax the principle of equality."  If people don't need equal participation, then the demos can be voted on by others. p474

Future avenues: p475

 - Decision independence
 - Rootedness
 - Equality
 - Feasiblity
