# Computer Simulation vs Thought Experiments
 
Thought Experiments are one of the oldest methodological tools used by philosophers.

  - Plato's Alegory of the Cave
  - Zeno??
  - Plutarch's Ship of Theseus
  - Hobbes' State of Nature

Computer simulation by contrast, is one of the newest.

  - Skrimm's Evolution of Cooperation
  - more needed

Despite the significant difference in provenance between the two methods, they share many characteristics. (what)

  - both involve the construction of models to ...
  - both instantiate a model via simulation (digital vs imagination)

While thought experiment and computer simulation are analogous in many ways, there are some important differences.

  - Internal vs external obviously.

  - Computability: Thought experiements must be simple to remain computable.  Computer simulations can handle much greater amounts of complexity.

  - Proximity: The power of thought experiments stems from their accessability & phemonenology.  It is the experience of the result within the imagination that gives them their ooomph.

  - Confidence: We can be
