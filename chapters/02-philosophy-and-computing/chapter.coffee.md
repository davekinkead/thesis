1) sketch out the nature of the field relevant to the inquiry – including history if relevant and
2) identity major debates and define terms, in order to
3) establish which studies, ideas and/or methods are most pertinent to your study, and
4) locate gaps in the field, in order to
5) create a warrant for the study in question, and
6) identify the contribution the study might make

## Use Cases

While we have so far explored how simulation has been used as a philosophical method, this is not the only way computers can be used.

> New communication technologies have enabled faster, more convenient means of contributing to and drawing from the philosophical corpus, but there has been no major shift in the format of research communications since the foundation of the Royal Society in the 17th Century. Philosophers still communicate their research mostly through books and articles, whether in print or delivered verbally through talks and lectures. -- @bourget2010 p1

**Online Discussion**

  - Blogs
  - arxiv

> The fluid and iterative nature of online discussions also makes them more effi- cient means of communication than papers for most purposes. -- @bourget2010 p2

> These problems are often not philosophical problems but pure com- munication problems -- @bourget2010 p2


**Data Colleciton**

  - surveys
  - analytics
  - Xphi


**The philosophical registry (hypothetical)**

Philosophy can be produced digitally...

  - wordprocessing
  - collaboratively
  - computationally

Philosophy can be distributed digitally...

  - Online Journals
  - SEP

Philosophy can be consumed digitially...

These are all examlpes of digital philosophy but that doesn't make them computational philosophy..

Define terms _digital_ and _computational_ as the non-essential and essential use of computers in philosophical investigation.


- Philosophy Blogs (digital, incremental, dissemination)
- SEP (digital, incremental, dissemination)
- PhilPapers (digital, incremental, dissemination) (helping consumption)
- Skyrms (computational, transformational, production)
- Surveys - What Do Philosophers Believe @bourget (digital, incremental, production)
- A computationally-discovered simplification of the ontological argument (computational, transformational, production)




- used in 
  - proof checking and as proofing labs
  - modelling knowledge (paraconsistant)
  - phil mind & AI
  - phil language NLP

**Modelling knowledge (paraconsistant)**

**Logic Provers for Discovery**

  - @oppenheimer2011 uses PROVER9 to discover a new simpler ontological argument for God.  **The paper looks to be (in appearence) the closest philsophy has come to literate programming although the source code is elsewhere.**

  - @blusom2017 follows @zalta's approach to automated verification of Anselm’s ontological argument. Uses a computer proving language (Isabelle) to prove another computer generated argument. 


**Natural Language Processing**


**Text Mining to answer questions _in_ philosophy**

  - @ashton2018 uses data mining and text analysis to address claims in philosophy to test claims about the methodological significance of intuition talk ... computer assisted research to parse a corpus of philosophical texts.

  - @ashton2018b similar techneque to indentify the use of deductive & inductive arguments by looking for argument indicator words.

**Network analysis -- sociology**

  - https://kieranhealy.org/philcites/

**Simulations to investigate philosophical questions**

  - @tamariz2011 uses simulation to explore a linguistic bootstrapping thesis
  - @olson2011 uses desktop sim to explore truth networks in agents to address claims in @goodman1999
