- interactive computer games to provide player phenomological understanding of concepts

- Neccessary Evil, a critical game by Stefano Gualeni http://evil.gua-le-ni.com/, lets players experience the perspective of secondary characters (dungeon monsters) to challenge the domainant player-centric model of games

> NECESSARY EVIL is an experimental video game designed with the objective of allowing the player to realize - via gameplay - that all video games are inherently developed on the basis of a player-centric ideology.

> In other words, videogames, their worlds and their narratives are customarily designed towards the disclosure of a certain player-experience. From the perspective of software architecture, video game worlds are generated around the player's possibility to perceive them or interact with them: objects in the world that are too far from the player, whose sight is occluded by other objects (or that are momentarily irrelevant for gameplay) literally do not exist as far as the game states are concerned. This technical materialization of an idealistic mindset has the functional scope of limiting the amount of calculations that are needed to run the video game world. It is a desirable, if not necessary, evil.

> pursues its goals as a critical artifact mainly by giving the player control over a contributory character: a disposable baddy. Impersonating a marginal character, the playersâ€™ possibility for interaction as well as the duration and the quality of their experience are necessarily limited and unsatisfactory. In other words, our game discloses for the players a world that, for once, is not build around them and their expectations.
