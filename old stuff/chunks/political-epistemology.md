# Political Epistemology

Epistemology is a normative endeavour - it tells us how we ought to reason from evidence and how we ought to justify our beliefs [@sep].  Political epistemology is simply a subset of epistemology in general, applied to a particular domain.  My interest then, is how ought we justify our beliefs in political authority.

By this however, I do not mean to examine whether political authority _can_ be justified.  Considerable work has already been done on this [see @green, @simmons, @wolff etc] My interest is not in some meta-political conception of authority - whether or not it is some kind of error theory or the like.  If this were the case, then we would be firmly entrenched in the _a priori_ anarchist position with RP Wolff and also likely have to give up obligations from promising.  That's a step too far for me - at least for now.

Rather, my interest is in what the criteria for justifying political authority (of the legitimate kind) is.  My thinking is currently emerging something like this...

1. Effective political authority requires requires the acquiescence of its subjects.

2. _De jure_ political authority implies moral obligations to obey.

3. So _de jure_ political authority is an easy/best/cheapest way of securing the acquiescence of subjects.

4. Those obligations must be grounded in some normative belief.

5. These beliefs can (and should) be assessed against some kind of epistemic standard.

So we can imagine the following scenarios:

1. Subjects acquiesce because they believe they have obligations to obey and those beliefs are epistemically justified

2. Subjects acquiesce because they believe they have obligations to obey but those beliefs are not epistemically justified.

3. Subjects do not acquiesce because they do not believe they have obligations to obey and those beliefs are epistemically justified

4. Subjects do not acquiesce because they do not believe they have obligations to obey but those beliefs are not epistemically justified.

So what I need to do obviously is to advance an account outlining what criteria justifies a belief in obligation.  Now perhaps I can find this in general debates in epistemology proper but I'm doubtful for a few reasons.

Firstly, existing literature on moral and political epistemology focuses almost solely on the truth content of beliefs.  But I'm not concerned with moral and political knowledge.  In fact, I don't see why I even need to take a position on this. No, all I think I need to do is identify when a belief in political authority is or isn't justified and then show that accounts of democratic authority fail to satisfy whatever criteria there are for justification.

Second, most theories of knowledge are concerned with truth.  I'm doubtful that moral & political reasoning can ever move beyond something like @foot's _morality as a system of hypothetical imperatives_.  The debate in meta-ethics shows the difficulty in reaching any objective of absolute criteria of truth so it seems focusing on grounds for belief justification will be much more productive.

So what could this criteria of justification be? Sadly, I have no idea....
